10,43758,GaiaSeed: Project Seed Trap,"[7, 9, 38, 46]",[5],Gaia Seed is a horizontally scrolling shooter from Techno Soleil The game comes from the fabulous line of classicallystyled Japanese shoot em ups bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling screenfilling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety The game has tight control precise bullet collision and a simple powerup system while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its technoambiance mood adding to the subliminal nature of the work  You have a single ship choice and three difficulties Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL and isnt particularly challenging anyway You get two extra credits in NORMAL for a total of 5 which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending No one should touch EASY since it limits you to reaching Stage 4 There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings none of which are affected by credit usage  Powerups consist of 2 main shots RED and BLUE 2 subweapons YELLOW and GREEN and an eIntense Shot based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb Main weapons stack up to 3 times RED starts on 1 shot then 2 3 and finally 4 shots subweapons dont stack Lose a ship and you lose your subweapon while your main weapon goes down one level  BLUE is the Laser Shot a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it The lasers eintense shot is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path RED is Needle Shot This is your typical Vshot weapon Less powerful than BLUE but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses making this the best main weapon GREEN is the Cipher Wave the best subweapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you which is essential during boss fights YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional Vshot weapon Absolute rubbish  With such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the games duration Which isnt a criticism Gaia Seed doesnt distract you with superfluity its functional with a focus on dodging and shooting Whats especially cool and sets it apart from other shmups is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health  but it doesnt break the games balancing  Enemies frequently use screenfilling beambased draining weapons forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beams attack before your life is fully drained With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance  especially if youre trying to beat them by letting the timer run down those are some pretty intense 120 seconds After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screens edge healing while avoiding bullet patterns The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance as pointed out by Mag Weasel  A mention must go to Gaia Seeds timed bosses Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesnt do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment but if you want to see the best ending youll let the two final Stage 7 bosses live  Visually almost everything is sprite based though it varies in terms of quality The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling though not as good as in Thunder Force IV Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair  The stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack which almost warrants download alone Its extremely unconventional being a blend of ambient music with chanting classical music hiphop and thumping techno Stage 2s track almost sounds as if its been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga Its eclectic strange and very good The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa also known as Naoto Ishikawa a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou Interestingly he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endos Kings Field soundtrack to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard  Kings Field I Arrange Collection,Missing,Missing,,,,,,

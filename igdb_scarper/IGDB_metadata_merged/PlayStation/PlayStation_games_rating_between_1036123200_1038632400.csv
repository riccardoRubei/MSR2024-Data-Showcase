for his people to call him should they ever be in danger During his absence however the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellions people by infecting them with a deadly virus A virus that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana As the only one controlling the catanasupport Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him In order to prevent Athelions return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the kings promise Forgotten until Haven one of the slaves starts having dreams about a hill and a bell dreams whose meaning he does not understand When the news of the Havens dreams reach Lord Vetch he orders to murder him Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch reign  Haven is a fastpaced actionpacked platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a ShootEm Up than a platformer There are also several vehicles to control ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders spaceships and jetpacks Despite all these action elements there are also some slower paced levels which put more emphasize on puzzlesolving and exploration  Havens conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews a fairly wellknown English scififantasy artist which is evident in Havens surrealistic bizarre design,The game begins with Vetch voiced by Steve Tarlow receiving a transmission from his lieutenant Overlord Jason Gregory who tells him a slave named Haven has been dreaming about the Golden Voice Rather than kill Haven Vetch decides to watch him hoping to turn the situation to his own advantage Meanwhile in Virescent Village on the planet Ferra Haven Jake RosewallGallagher is completing his latest invention a mechanical bird named Talon Upon finishing Haven heads to work in the mines However upon entering he sees his friend Chess Regan Kerwan being questioned by a guard The guard tries to shoot Haven but misses and causes the mine to collapse knocking out Haven  He awakens under the treatment of Dr Spong Andrew Silber who tells him Chess hasnt been seen since the collapse Setting out to find her he eventually reaches Darkwater Castle home of Overlord who contacts Vetch to tell him Haven has infiltrated the castle as they planned Haven watches Overlord interrogate Chess about Havens dreams She refuses to tell him anything and Haven intervenes killing Overlord and freeing Chess They escape and Chess says that while in detention she heard Overlord mention a wise old slave on the Isle of Heroes Haven decides he must speak to this slave  Haven heads to the Isle of Heroes and meets the Wise Man Terry Bertram He tells him of his dreams of a golden bell on top of a mountain and the Wise Man tells him the legend of Athellion and the Golden Voice Vetch and Athellion were enemies for many years and Vetch was determined to conquer Athellions city Aurias However he was unable to even approach the city as its light would blind him When Athellion left for the war he left behind the Golden Bell but Vetch bribed a council member named Dasis to infect the people of Aurias with a virus for which he controlled the only antidote Making the people of Aurias his slaves he sealed off the Mount of Sighs on which resides the Golden Voice Over time even the location of the Mount of Sighs has been forgotten However the Wise Man tells Haven when Vetch first came to Aurias the people hid many artifacts inside a volcano named Mount Firash and speculates there may be something there which can point the way to the Mount  Haven heads to Firash and locates a map identifying the location of the Mount on the planet Auria However as he escapes Firash he is captured and placed in the Sylex a space station prison He flees in an escape pod and lands on Exarco a planet populated by lizardlike humanoids He soon meets brothers Chill Dale Stump and Will Aubrey Hodges They tell him they will give him a ship if he helps them protect their eggs from giant insectoidlike creatures Haven does so however the insect queen attacks the local village Haven defeats her and Chill and Will present him with the ship Sunsurfer He then heads to Auria  He makes it to the Golden Voice reading a warning stating that once the bell is rung the person who rings it must wait there for Athellions return He rings it but immediately Chess contacts him telling him she is stranded without any antidote He reluctantly leaves returning to Ferra and rescuing Chess She tells him she was using a device she found in Overlords castle to try to find the antidote refinery so as to free the slaves Haven attaches the device to the Sunsurfer navigation computer and they head to the refinery on the planet Ferven  They pump the antidote into a waiting transport ship and the duo escape However Chess reveals she has been working with Vetch all along who appears on the bridge and congratulates her on her deception Vetch tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies deployed throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellions return Athellion must return to wherever that person is  thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven and then kill him With no more use for Chess Vetch decides she can die with Haven At this moment Athellion arrives telling Vetch he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared Vetch agrees imprisoning them and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs  Haven escapes but is unable to free Chess and so sets out in pursuit of Vetch alone promising to return for Chess He returns to the Mount of Sighs where he hears Vetch tell Athellion that he will kill Haven and Chess once Athellion is dead He then kills Athellion Haven confronts him but Vetch defeats him However the power of the Mount of Sighs keeps Haven alive As such Vetch ties Haven to a rock pointing out you cant live forever and leaves him alone on the planet The game ends on this cliffhanger,Missing,9.04,0.0,0.0,54.0,8.0,6.0

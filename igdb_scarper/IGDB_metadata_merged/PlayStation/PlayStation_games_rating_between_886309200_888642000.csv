24,[12],1346,Xenogears,"[7, 9]",Xenogears follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey to uncover the truth behind mysterious cabalistic entities operating in their world The principles and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung influence the plot character design and world of Xenogears Additionally the symbols theological concepts and devotional practices of several world religions are represented in fictionalized forms in the game Major psychological themes are the nature of identity and human memory particularly as these relate to the phenomenon of dissociative identity disorder The relationship between humanity and machines is central to the games plot as indicated by the presence of giant robots dubbed gears which almost each playable character can control,Full Story spoils everything  In the beginning Deus was created This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move  The creation of an unknown spacefaring civilization Deus was originally intended to serve as a biological weapon To power Deus an entity known as the Wave Existance is summoned from another dimension and trapped inside Deuss engine Zohar However its creators deem Deus too powerful to use and they attempt to dispose of it by shipping it away on a spaceship called the Eldridge  Deus being a sentient organism discovers the plan to eliminate it and attacks the Eldridge in transit After much gratuitous usage of the word evacuate the Eldrige crashes on a nearby planet The sole survivor of the crash is a young boy  the first incarnation of Fei  who was left crying for his mother  Although its physical form was trapped inside Zohar the Wave Existance is able to instill its power in the boy who had looked upon it during the attack in an effort to destroy Deus and free itself The Wave Existance than creates a woman  Elly  in the image of Feis mother and gave her its will  In order to defend itself Deus used part of itself to create the first humans  Cain the Gazel and Miang Miang possesses the Ouroborous or Urobulos according to Professor Daravon _ Gene which is passed on to all the women in the world as they were all descended from her This gene allowed any woman to become Miang thus guaranteeing her immortatilty  The next time we see Fei and Elly they are in their second incarnation the Wave Existance keeps reincarnated them Fei is called Abel and Elly is Elly as always They are running from Cain who kills Elly  Fei and Ellys third incarnation occurs in the Zeboim civilization which I think is supposed to be presentday Earth Here people live in flying cities above the ground and fight with giant robots called Gears which use the energy emitted from Zohar to function However genetic flaws have rendered many people including Elly unable to have children Kim Fei who seems to be a scientist creates an articial human with selfhealing nanomachines whom he names Emeralda Just then guards burst in and kill Elly and presumably Kim as well  When the fourth incarnation rolls around only one flying city remains from the collapsed Zeboim civilization Solaris ruled by Emperor Cain and the Gazel Ministry Solaris rules the world below but a band of rebels including Lacan Feis fourth incarnation SophiaElly her real name seems to be Elly but she is known as Sophia in Nisan Krelian and Roni and Rene Fatima are fighting against them  The landdwellers are aided by Shevat a new flying city being constructed atop the Tower of Babel which is also part of the Ft Jasper weapons system under the supervision of Queen Zephyr Shevat is also home to three Gurus  Gaspar Taura Melchior and Balthasar Taura teaches Krelian about nanotechnology  Shevat however decides to reveal the position of the rebels to Solaris in exchange for their own safety Solaris promptly attacks the rebel camp in Nisan catching the troops off guard To defend her people SophiaElly sends her ship on a suicide run at the Gebler forces Her comrades escape but Krelian goes postal and runs off saying that if there must be no god and he will create god himself Lacan also goes berserk and is transformed by the Wave Existance into two parts  his body becomes Grahf while his soul is passed on to the next incarnation  Soon thereafter a bunch of mysterious monsters called the Diabolos appear and attack the world Solaris and the landdwellers call a temporary truce to their fighting to fight the Diabolos With the power of the Omnigears such as Ronis Andvari the humans win During the conflict however the Gazel are killed and their personalities are stored in the data banks of Solariss SOL9000 computer  In the aftermath of the war Solaris sets up the Ethos a faux religion with which they control the earthdwellers and begins using its Soylent System to turn the test subjects of its genetic experiments into food products or Wels A special drug the Limiter is placed in the food which renders those who consume it  all the landdwellers  unable to resist Solaris  As the loser of the war Shevat goes into hiding by concealing itself behind its Gate Roni and Rene found Aveh and Kiselv is also founded by some other guy we dont know who Meanwhile Krelian has joined Solaris to pursue his mission of resurrecting Deus  Several hundred years later things have changed little Solaris has been manipulating a war between Aveh and Kislev on the surface to prevent the earthdwellers from gaining in power Krelian who is pulling all the strings in Solaris attempts to create a Contact for the Wave Existance He genetically engineers a clone of Cain that features all the best traits of humanity  Ramsus  in hopes that he will be able to contact the Wave Existance He soon discovers that Ramsus is not needed as the real Contact has been born to Wong Khan and Karen agents of Shevat  Miang takes over the body of Wong Karen and begins subjecting Fei to psychological tests to determine if he is really the Contact Time again and time again Fei destroys the Solaris researchers who try to probe his mind  Grahf who has gone through several bodies in his quest for destruction hears of Feis birth and journeys to the Wongs home in Lahan in order to claim the body of the new incarnation of Lacan He uses his powers to draw out Feis inner power and he Fei unleashes a blast of energy that kills Karen Grahf then spirits the awakened Fei away and makes him his righthand man  Meanwhile in Aveh the Fatima Dynasty is overthrown by Shakhan an Ethos bishop who has the backing of Solaris behind him King Edbart is killed but his sons Bart and Sigurd and retainer Maison escape in the Yggdrasil the Aveh flagship and go to live in Nisan Solaris sends General Vanderkaum to control the Gebler forces  Sigurd however is abducted by Solaris and forced to join Jugend their military academy He eventually joins the Elements force along with Hyuga Ricdeau Citan Miang in yet another new body and Jessiah Black HyugaCitan and Sigurd are both supporters of Ramsuss rebellion against the Solaris class system  Ramsus is called into action when Grahf and Id attack Elru on the surface Id singlehandedly trashes Ramsuss Gear battalion and the entire country is destroyed The only survivor is Dominia who joins with Solaris and later becomes part of the Elements after Jessiah quits to live on the surface with his wife Racquel  Wong Khan catches up with Id and Grahf and somehow seals the Id part of Feis personality inside and constructs a new persona over it This persona the Coward refuses to acknowledge what he has done however and creates a third persona  the normal Fei  to deal with his problems while the Coward relives the memories of his childhood Meanwhile Grahf takes over Khans body but his control is incomplete  during lapses of Grahfs control Khan returns to his normal self and during one of these periods he brings Fei to Lahan Village and leaves him there in the care of Chief Lee  Sigurd regains his memories of his life on the surface and escapes Solaris to return to aid Bart He Maison and Hans the penguin use the Yggdrasil to prey on Aveh and Kislev troops thereby keeping either side from becoming too strong and keeping the balance of power  Also defecting from Solaris is Nikolai Balthasar son of Shevats Balthazar He attempts to flee to Shevat after finding out what Krelian had planned for his Gear research Deuss revival but is killed in the attempt and has his mind implanted into the Achtzehn Gear His daughter Maria manages to escape in the Achtzehns sister Gear Siebzehn  Citan remains behind in Solaris but is later send to the surface by Cain on a mission to spy on Fei and determine whether he poses a danger  While not in Khan mode Grahf is scheming to get Fei back under his control He has the Kaiser of Kislev manufacture a Gear to his specifications then arranges for a Gebler force from Aveh to steal it and land in Lahan A battle ensues during which Fei hops on board the Weltall as planned and uses Ids power to destroy Lahan  Forced out of the village by the survivors Fei journeys south through the Blackmoon Forest where he meets the fifth incarnation of Elly a Gebler officer and the leader of the group that attacked Lahan After Fei saves her from some really wimpy monsters that she could have beaten on her own she travels with Fei for a short while That evening Citan shows up and recommends that Elly leave and return to her family in Solaris She reluctantly agree  Citan and Fei are hunting for parts for the damaged Weltall when they are captured by an Aveh transport that was seeking the Weltall The transport is in turn attacked by the Yggdrasil and Fei and Citan are brought aboard They agree to help Bart in his mission to rescue Margie who has been captured by Shakhan  The trio frees Margie and ChuChu _ from Fatima Castle and escapes back to Nisan to plan their next move Meanwhile Ramsus is appointed head of the Gebler forces and Vanderkaum is demoted to border patrol  To overthrow Shakhan Bart and Citan sneak into the castle while Fei causes a distraction at the Kislev border Shakhan sees through their plan and surrounds Barts team and they are saved only when Maison rescues them in Citans Land Crab Fei meets with more success as he destroys the Gebler flagship Kefeinzel and Vanderkaums Gear the Dora Grahf then shows up and gives Vanderkaum the power forcing Fei to transform into Id Id then annihilates Vanderkaum Barts troops and the Yggdrasil and severely damages Ramsuss Gear Citan evacuates the Yggdrasil as it goes down and heads to Nortune to find Fei  Fei is picked up by some Kislev soldiers and at Miangs request is transferred to the prison block of Nortune the capital of Kislev Grahf also has the Battling committee actively recruit Fei and then arranges for the Weltall to be given to him when he enters Little does Fei know that the Weltall has been rigged to overheat during the match thus putting Fei out of comission While unconscious he changes into Id and kills Ricos men believing them to be responsible  After Fei wakes up he is confronted by Rico who informs that he is being held responsible for the death of the sewer guards Rico Fei and Citan go to the sewers to investigate and fight and kill a monster called Redrum actually one of the Wels thus solving the mystery Ricos arm is wounded during the battle with Redrum however thus allowing Fei to defeat him in the Battling tournament and become the new Battling champion  Meanwhile the Ethos is plotting to eliminate Kaiser Sigmund as he has been acting too independtly from Solaris They rig Ricos Gear to go berserk and attack the Kaisers box but the Kaiser narrowly escapes death For this incident Rico is sentenced to be executed but he ends up being rescued by Fei Citan and Hammer  Growing desperate the Gazel order the entire city bombed into oblivion The Elements and Ellys Gebler squadron are assigned to carry out the mission but Elly defects to Feis side and aids him and Rico in directing the Hecht off course Grahf shows up at the last minute to save Elly  Back in Aveh Bart and co miraculously survive the sinking of the Yggdrasil when they end up in an underground cave containing another Yggdrasil dating back to Ronis era This one is designed for sea travel so Barts band hits the seas and shoots down Kislevs new Goliath airship on its way to Aveh only to discover that it was actually Fei and his friends trying to escape from Kislev in the stolen plane  Fei and Elly are rescued by the Thames a floating town commanded by the Man of the Sea The Thames is currently working for the Ethos which is trying to excavate some Zeboim ruins in order to acquire technology that would allow them to break away from Solaris  Bart shows up in the Yggdrasil and apologizes for shooting down the Goliath After a number of failed attacks by Solaris Ramsus eventually manages to succeed in injuring Fei in combat Seeing that Feis wounds require medical attention the party seeks the help of the healers at the Ethos While still on the Thames they meet Billy Lee Black a priestexorcist from the Ethos when they save his sister Primera Billy agrees to help Fei so they take him to the Ethos Headquarters elsewhere in Aquvy and have him treated by the doctors there He is promptly released and taken back to the Yggdrasil sick bay  In gratitude for Billys help the party agrees to accompany him on a mission to destroy a Solaris ship infested with Wels mutants The mission is a success but when Billy returns to the Ethos HQ he finds everyone dead The attack is the work of his mentor Bishop Stone who killed all those who were attempting to break away from Solaris Stone escapes in his Alkanshel I think thats supposed to be Archangel Gear to attack the Thames  During the battle the Alkanshel is joined by a black fishbowl device I believe its the Soylent System that drops out Wels The Thames manages to fend off the attack but not without being damaged Citan and the gang follow the fishbowl to a supposedlyabandoned Solaris dig site where they discover Emeralda still left in the tube that she had been created in 4000 years ago But before they can free her Stone arrives and captures her so that Krelian can use her in his nanotechnology experiments While the party is pursuing Stone out of the dig site Fei suddenly shows up in Id form and demands that Stone release his daughter Stone escapes and suddenly KhanWiseman shows up to hold off Id while the party escapes  Back on the Yggdrasil Fei turns up at the Gear Dock at loss as to what happened to him Then Stone now merged with his Gear attacks but Billy and Jessie team up to put him out of commission The party then goes to Shevat to ally with Solariss rival There they meet Maria and Queen Zephyr Meanwhile Dominia sneaks into the city and shuts off the shield generators allowing Solaris to attack  Fei and friends fend off the initial assault but then the Achtzehn arrives and uses its Psycho Jammer to freeze the Gears Enter ChuChu who uses her Churansformation to assume the size of a Gear and fend off the Achtzehn Nikolai then transfers his consciousness from Achtzehn to Siebzehn and has Maria destroy Achtzehn  Back on the surface Shakhans forces invade Nisan Bart rushes to Nisan and enters the underground Ft Jasper where he discovers Ronis Andvari Omnigear As Ft Jasper is raised from the ground Shakhan attacks it but is forced to retreat Bart chases Shakhan to a cave and finishes him off also destroying one of Solariss Gate generators in the process Meanwhile Barts soldiers retake the capital and Bart assumes the throne  To destroy the second Gate Billy fires a beam from the recentlyexcavated Ft Jasper It bounces off the lens on Babel Tower designed for just that purpose and demolishes the Gate under the Ethos HQ The last Gate lies underwater at Sargasso Point so Fei and co dive down to destroy it Along the way they encounter Emeralda who is under Krelians control After destroying the Gate they convince Emeralda to come back with them to the Yggdrasil  With all three Gates destroyed Solaris appears in the sky Fei and Elly sneak into the capital district and after being chased by some Security Cubes make their way to Ellys house They attempt to use Ellys fathers computer but are caught by Erich To Feis surprise Erich lets him go and tells him to follow his own path  Elly stays behind at her house but soon some Solaris soldiers arrive and demand that her parents turn over Elly for her traitorous acts Erich stalls the soldiers while Elly escapes She catches Fei and Citan on their way into the palace via a dust chute  In the palace Elly confronts Citan with the accumulated evidence that he is working for Solaris Before Citan can reply the lights go out In the dark Fei stumbles into the SOL9000 and is captured Meanwhile Citan frees Elly and the rest of the party who was captured earlier and removes their Limiters Hammer is confronted by Krelian who threatens to mutate him unless he carries out his orders To capture Elly whom Krelian needs to resurrect Deus  Hammer is forced to comply and while the party is making their escape with Ellys parents he suddenly points a gun at Elly Medena forces her way into the path of the gun and advances on Hammer Hammer panics shoots her and runs off Just then Grahf and Miang show up and kill Erich in an effort to awaken Elly They meet with no success but Fei is awakened and turns into Id He then destroys Solaris completely though all of the major villains escape  Shevat insists on carbonfreezing Fei to prevent him from using his Id power again but Elly frees him They fly away in Weltall but Ramsus arrives Since he last fought Fei Ramsus has learned that he was an artificial Contact created and was discarded once Fei was discovered and now is obsessed killing him Using his new Omnigear he shoots down Weltall  After their crash landing Fei and Elly are nursed back to health by Taura Melchior who lives in seclusion on the surface Elly Citan and Emeralda fire the Limiter cure out of a cannon to spread it across the world while Fei hurries off to Kislev to stop a lastditch attack by Solaris He and Bart combine the Imperial District with the Yggdrasil to form a Gear and destroy Solariss Fort Hurricane  Krelian activates the Soylent System and starts mutating people into forms in which they will be able to be assimilated by Deus While the sisters of Nisan try to cure the mutated people Fei and company destroy the Soylent System and the Sufal Mass a huge creature formed of amalgamated mutants  While Fei and co search for the remaining Anima Relics that they can use to enhance their Gears Krelian convinces Ramsus to kill Cain  as a clone of Cain Ramsus is the only one who can kill him Krelian also melds Hammer with a Gear and sends him after Fei but Hammer is killed  With Cain out of the way the Gazel are able to use the Gaetia Key to raise the Eldridge from the sea  and in turn Krelian summarily erases them from the data banks leaving him in command Fei shows up in the Eldridge to prevent Krelian from locating Deuss shell but Grahf takes him captive and tries to crucify him Elly comes to the rescue in her Omnigear and succeeds in rescuing Fei but then she is captured by Krelian and Grahf  Krelian begins construction of Merkava the ark of god which he will use to return to the dimension the Wave Existance is from Fei and Ramsus attempt to stop him Ramsus kills both Krelian and Miang but Krelian has already merged with Deus and Miang merely assumes the body of Elly Enraged Fei turns into Id again and is once again carbonfrozen  While Deus starts assimilating the people of the planet Id breaks out of his prison and destroys Shevat Citan and the other characters catch up with him on his way to Contact the Wave Existance With the aid of Khan Fei eventually resolves all his multiple personalities then the Wave Existance appears and changes the Weltall into the Xenogears  Grahf takes over Khans body again and tries to kill Fei Then Deus strikes however attempting to destroy Fei before Fei does the same to Deus GrahfLacanKhan sacrifices himself as a decoy Fei while Fei and his friends return to Merkava to destroy Deus They succeed in destroying Zohar the core thus freeing the Wave Existance The energy emitted by the Wave Existance threatens to destroy the world so Elly now part of Deus uses her powers to move Deus out into space  With the destruction of Zohar all the Gears have stopped working except Feis which has evolved due to his Contact Fei blasts out into space after Deus and ends up being sucked into some superduper dimension where he must battle the Ouroborous

Langdon Robert Clotworthy a Harvard professor of symbology in Paris for a lecture arriving at the Louvre where he has been asked to view a crime scene by Cpt Bezu Fache Enn Reitel Jacques Saunière Neil Ross Langdons friend and curator of the museum has been murdered In flashback Silas is shown asking Saunière where something is Saunière tells him and Silas responds I believe you The others told me the same before shooting him  In the museum Fache shows Langdon that before he died Saunière wrote a numeric cipher and a message O Draconian Devil Oh Lame Saint in blacklight ink At this point Sophie Neveu Jennifer Hale a member of the cryptography department arrives explaining the cipher is part of the Fibonacci sequence although the numbers are out of order She then secretly tells Langdon he is in danger as Fache thinks he is the murderer In the toilets she reveals the police have planted a GPS tracking device on Langdon Neveu tells him that also written in black light ink were the words PS Find Robert Langdon She explains that Saunière was her grandfather and PS was his nickname for her Princess Sophie She believes that Saunière included the numerical cipher in the message to insure her involvement in the case  Langdon throws the GPS device onto a passing car and most of the police leave the museum to follow He and Neveu return to the body and Langdon realizes the numbers are out of sequence to tell them that the letters are also out of sequence the words are anagrams He deciphers Draconian Devil as Leonardo da Vinci and Oh Lame Saint as The Mona Lisa As they head to the painting Langdon speculates PS could also refer to the Priory of Sion His theory is strengthened when Neveu remembers seeing the letters together with a fleurdelis when she was a child PS combined with a fleurdelis is the coat of arms of the Priory At the Mona Lisa they find a substitution cipher written in black light ink on the glass around the painting The clues lead them to Saunières office where they listen to a message in which Sister Sandrine of SaintSulpice tells Saunière the floor is broken and the other three are dead A window is heard smashing and a man says Your fate was sealed the moment you stood against Manus Dei As they continue to follow clues left by Saunière eventually Neveu concludes they must head to his chateau She and Robert split up as she heads to the chateau and he heads to SaintSulpice  Once there he finds a monk attacking a young nun He knocks the monk out and the nun Sister Marguerite Jane Carr tells him that Sandrine is dead killed by Silas who was looking for something that Sandrine refused to give him He left moments before the monks arrived who seemed to be trying to erase evidence of his actions Langdon concludes the monks are members of Sanctus Umbra a militant subgroup of Manus Dei Langdon examines the broken floor at the base of the Gnomon of SaintSulpice and finds a stone tablet with Job 3811 inscribed on it Hitherto shalt thou come but no further He deduces that Silas was misled by Saunière and the others He heads into the crypt where he finds a list of Priory Grand Masters discovering Saunière was the current Master  Meanwhile at the chateau Neveu heads for Saunières underground grotto She evades both Silas and the police and follows a series of clues to find a key with the address of the Depository Bank of Zurich Meeting up with Langdon they head to the bank where they open Saunières deposit box finding a cryptex They then head to Château Villette the residence of Sir Leigh Teabing Greg Ellis Langdons friend and one of the worlds foremost experts on the Holy Grail Teabing and Langdon explain to Neveu that the Grail is not a cup but a reference to a woman Looking at da Vincis The Last Supper Teabing explains the image of John is actually Mary Magdalene to whom the historical Jesus was married This marriage was suppressed by the early Church who needed its followers to believe Jesus was divine Teabing explains that the chalice that held the blood of Christ the Holy Grail of legend was Mary herself as she was pregnant with Jesus child At this point Silas arrives revealing he murdered Saunière under the orders of The Teacher Langdon and Neveu incapacitate him and with Teabing and his servant Remy Andres Aguilar they head to London taking the unconscious Silas with them  Landing at Biggin Hill they head to Temple Church Langdon and Teabing go inside but in the courtyard Neveu sees Remy betray them and send a gang of thugs in after them Langdon wakes up in a dungeon but manages to escape and meets up with Neveu He tells her Remy is holding Teabing hostage to use him as a bargaining chip for the cryptex Inside the church Remy and Silas confront Langdon and Neveu who flee and head to Westminster Abbey where Teabing is being held Once there they decide they must solve the cryptex to bargain for Teabings life Following a series of clues left by Saunière they do so but before they can open it they are captured by Remy He takes them to Teabing who reveals himself to be The Teacher He shoots Remy as he no longer needs him and reveals Silas has just been arrested for the recent murders He tells Langdon and Neveu the Priory was supposed to make public the contents of the cryptex on the eve of the New Millennium but Saunière decided against it As such Teabing determined to reveal the documents himself He asks Langdon and Neveu to join him in revealing the truth about Mary Magdalene but they refuse and Langdon destroys the cryptex Teabing is arrested as he laments the truth being lost forever  However Langdon had removed the document before destroying the device Following the clue contained within he and Neveu head to Rosslyn Chapel There they find a family tree for the SaintClair family running back to the Merovingian dynasty In a series of documents they learn that when Sophies family were killed in a car accident newspaper reports said that all of the family were killed mother father and two children The reports also state the familys name was SaintClair Langdon realizes the truth Neveu survived the accident and the Priory put out the story she was dead to protect her as she is a living blood relative of Jesus Neveus grandmother then arrives explaining the family changed its name for protection She introduces Neveu to her brother who also survived the crash he came to Scotland whilst Neveu went to France with Saunière Neveus grandmother then tells Langdon that the grail is not in Rosslyn it is in France He realizes the clue in the cryptex didnt point to Rosslyn but to the Rose Line in Paris He says goodbye to Neveu and heads to France finally understanding the grail lies beneath the Louvre

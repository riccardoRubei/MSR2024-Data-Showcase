expedition to LV426  including the command ship Resolute and the advanced research transport USS Legato the latter of which carried a cargo of human colonists kept in stasis to be used as hosts to breed Xenomorphs However the expedition arrived at the moon only after the destruction of Hadleys Hope and the departure of the USS Sulaco After investigating the coordinates of the derelict ship the

the corporates connect their ship with the Sulaco a Xenomorph outbreak erupts on the Legato  Colonist Lisbeth Hutchins awakens from stasis and pulls a dead Facehugger from her face She quickly meets

send to the United States Colonial Marine Corps when Stone denies any knowledge of such a message he is executed by one of the PMCs Hicks is chemically tortured for information while Weyland boasts how the colonists and human life in general are of little concern to him His callousness spurs WeylandYutani researcher Rick Levy to turn against his superior releasing Hicks and holding Weyland and his PMCs at gunpoint They fight their way through the Resolute and escape the ship by jettisoning in an EEV despite the fact they are within LV426s atmosphere  Once on the ground Hicks and Levy push through the research complex in the midst of a Xenomorph outbreak hoping to reach an uplink from which they can send the distress call Hicks and Levy stray into an extensive cave complex beneath the site and discover the second Acheron Queen which they narrowly escape They eventually arrive at a communications relay station and attempt to send Hicks message from there While in the process of sending the call Weyland contacts them and tells Levy he will not permit him to send the call and jeopardize what he is trying to accomplish Weyland then destroys the relay with a missile severing the uplink after only part of Hicks distress call could be sent The relay station is quickly surrounded by PMCs arriving in APCs and Hicks and Levy are recaptured Meanwhile several researchers restrain

weapon capable of killing spirits easily The operation is not successful however and the player is forced to infiltrate the company a second time alone in order to retrieve the only sample of the Aegis compound The player acquires the sample but is captured while trying to escape Given the importance and secrecy assigned to Aegis the player is brought before the owner of the company James Telestrian Here the player learns the truth behind Sam Watts and his sister that they were both half breed children of the Telestrian bloodline the product an affair between James father and Sams mother To prevent the truth of the affair from becoming public knowledge the senior Telestrian paid Sams mother handsomely and they officially became the offspring of James Watts another employee at Telestrian Industries This is important as the young woman who the player rescued from the Brotherhood is actually James daughter Jessica who is also revealed to be the insect shaman of the hive had

Harlequin who discusses how insect spirits need to inhabit bodies of sapient life forms to exist in the material world and also states that the existence of a Queen in the real world be disastrous Volunteering to help destroy the hive Harlequin joins the player and his team a the final raid on the Brotherhood chapter Telestrian gives the player and Harlequin each a shotgun able to fire capsules filled with the Aegis compound Before they leave the player also discovers that Lynne Telestrian is as fully committed to the hive as Jessica if not more so Her loyalty to the Brotherhood led her to blow up the Telestrian Industries factory producing Aegis recently not only estranging her from James but also leaving the sample and the prototype weapons the only articles remaining from the project The team infiltrates the hive and they fight their way into the heart of the inner sanctum There they discover Jessica and Lynne Telestrian in a magical circle since James daughter was taken out of their reach and thus can no longer become the host for the Queen Lynne has volunteered herself to be the host and they are in the process of completing the ritual The team disrupts the summoning by seriously wounding Jessica and killing most of the insect spirits inside the hive a feat made possible due to the Aegis weapons The queen spirit abandons Jessica and the player is given the option to kill her or arrest her Lynne survives but is arrested and eventually sent to a mental hospital The game concludes with Armitage Coyote Harlequin and James Telestrian discussing the fallout of the raid with Harlequin musing that other Brotherhood chapters across the world also hold hives similar to the one in Seattle Having satisfactorily solved the circumstances of Sams death the player attempts to collect the money he left Sams second message congratulating the player asks him to apologize to Jessica for what he put her through and that he never actually had any money in escrow and suggests the player ask the people he and his family knew for a reward of some kind which the player does at a 15 million Nuyen payment garnished after the assault on Telestrian industries to a mere 15000 Nuyen payout The player could also ask for the same money Sam promised a position as Security VP making them a company man for Telestrian the resignation of a particular officer or preserving Touristville In the epilogue following Sams last message the game reveals that Aegis was eventually developed into a product called Fluorescing Astral Bacteria3 or FAB3 As per the history of the penandpaper game Shadowrun Returns is based on the destruction of the Chicago Universal Brotherhood hive is botched and the city is largely sealed up behind a wall to keep the rampaging insect spirits inside the city

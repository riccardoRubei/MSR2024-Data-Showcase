expeditions to the surface much to Annas concern and Millers frustration However on one such expedition with Anna they witness a working train running on the surface Before they can follow it they are captured by Hansa soldiers along with a group of people who claim to be from outside of Moscow The Hansa soldiers execute the other prisoners and Artyom is shot and left for dead taking Anna to their

defected Hansa train engineer called Yermak  As the train leaves the Spartan Order moves in to retake it and are shocked and confused at Artyom and Annas presence Knowing that Hansa will have all of them put to death for knowing the truth Miller concludes that the Spartans best chance of survival is to flee Moscow Once outside the city he reveals to the others that while many of Russias cities were bombed the war did not end and NATO proceeded to occupy what was left of the nation To prevent NATO from attacking Moscow the Russian leadership decided to secretly jam all communications to make the outside world believe nobody had survived They then receive a radio broadcast from Moscow Defense Command calling for survivors to rally at the Ark located at Mount Yamantau Miller decides to head there believing that the Ark is where the Russian government has rebuilt itself  After crossing the cultcontrolled Volga River the Spartans reach the Yamantau base They discover the bases service and construction crew have devolved into cannibals who lure survivors in with the false promise of safety Artyom and the Spartans manage to fight their way out and escape but Millers faith in Russia is shattered when he discovers that the government never took refuge in Yamantau nor survived the war and thus the Spartans are left wondering what to do next Using a map they recovered from Yamantau

the Spartans steal water and fuel from the local bandits while obtaining an updated satellite map  As the Spartans continue on their journey Anna begins to cough up blood fearing the cause was accidentally breathing poison gas during the journey They decide to scout a nearby taiga forest valley to see if it is suitable to settle While scouting the forest Artyom is caught between two rival

worsened The Spartans detour to the heavilyirradiated city of Novosibirsk the closest location where an antidote may be found  Miller and Artyom decide to head into the city alone to search for the antidote despite the risk They enter the Novosibirsk Metro and find a young boy named Kirill one of the last of the Novosibirsk survivors who explains that his father left on a mission to obtain a map

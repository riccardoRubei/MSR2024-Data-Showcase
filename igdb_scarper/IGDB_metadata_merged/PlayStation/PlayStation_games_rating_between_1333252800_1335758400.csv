25,"[5, 15]",22321,Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims,[38],Missing,Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is a Playstation Mini game for PSP and Vita    Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is exactly that a 2D shooter built around the eponymous deity controlled by the player and his quest to protect eight pilgrims in their journey across perilous territories    Your own shots just knock their hats off but getting hit by anything else will kill a pilgrim and send their spirit floating off with a sad little wail This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar losing them all ends the game but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love  juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more    You must get all of the love given form as hearts that they release which then makes you much more powerful than you already are You increase in size look more menacing and your attacks are more powerful The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you When they are excited they produce more love meaning more power to you    However you have to be very careful when shooting You grow weaker with every shot so try not to channel your inner warfreak and have a little restraint for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces And sometimes the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self    There are two types of attack the normal shot by pressing X and the bomb shot by pressing Circle The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire You have to think through in real time what tactics you would like to employ You can always get in the middle then rush forward then get to a safe distance mix and match and you got yourself going    The bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy But thats not all as some enemies cant be killed with the bomb shot only with the normal shot and vice versa There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out    Enemies are varied and they look good even if they are vile and evil There are boss fights too to keep you on your toes The Cloud Gods powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink  so theyve got to be deceptive sneaky and sometimes numerous Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death redeyed foxes hide in the scenery imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses Hands start clawing up from the ground crows divebomb your crew and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous looping rockets The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dicknosed devils    As this suggests one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo This big lump of a thing which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy explodes into gobbets of minipoo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier Perhaps theyre babies That would explain the sadness    Floating Cloud God has bags more where that came from and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe there are seven worlds with 27 stages including boss fights And it keeps on surprising The controls are simplicity itself left stick to move one button to shoot and one to bomb But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and viceversa which fairly soon youre depending on against every enemy pattern The pilgrims too are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve    The final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything The pilgrims hats can be improved Theres no ingame benefit to this beyond looking much more awesome and its done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim Obviously if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim the hats just keep getting better    Seems like such a small thing doesnt it Soon nothing but a perfect run will do The restart option is accessible knowing and tempting Every time a pilgrim fell it was too much to take  I didnt see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions And to be fair by that point I had four dudes with top hats two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets You cant be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in    Thats the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims You do want to save them and not just because they represent health The hats are a big part of it but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god  harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves battling desperate rearguard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort which sometimes works The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand a blow to the daydreams of an allconquering deity    This description was compiled from the following reviews    httpwwweurogamernetarticles20120419floatingcloudgodsavesthepilgrimsreview

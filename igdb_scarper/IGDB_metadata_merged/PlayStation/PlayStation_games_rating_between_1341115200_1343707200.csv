paints the protagonist as the villain meeting a human avatar of Anna in the forest and falling in love with her However after she left because of his obsession with her and abusive personality he sacrificed children to summon her again  The game has three main endings in an inversion of the norm the more effort that is put into achieving an ending the less optimistic the conclusion will be In the first scenario the protagonist concludes that Anna was burnt as a witch centuries ago and leaves the house vowing never to return In the second ending the protagonist reminisces about Anna realizes that he cannot live without her and opens himself up to possession by her joining the multitude of mannequins that are found throughout the house In the third ending the protagonist remembers killing his real wife after she defiled Annas statue and finds the statue along with dolls of his children in a small chamber As the tunnel to the chamber caves in he realizes that he will stay in the chamber forever but he does not care because he has Anna with him  The plot is ambiguous due to the uncertainty of the protagonist as to whether or not the sawmill is real or merely a dream as well as the strange phenomena that occur throughout the story and the vague and unconnected nature of the voices  DEVELOPMENT Dreampainters the development studio based the story on legends from the Val DAyas region of Italy particularly one about a sawmill where a lumberjack killed his family They claimed that the games focus was on mysterysolving and exploration with the player being able to discover the plot at their own pace One of Annas particularly infamous features the ability to pick up any object no matter if it will be used later on in the game was apparently based on the developers hatred for adventure games and cartoons where the important objects were made more obvious to the viewer  Anna would reportedly have a feature whereby the game would interpret the players actions to try and scare them for example if a player focused on a particular object for too long that object would appear more often However no such feature appeared in the game Dreampainters also claimed that the extent of the protagonists descent into madness would determine the ending but the ending was actually determined by when the player decided to leave the sawmill  RECEPTION Anna received mixed reviews from critics The graphics story and sound were praised but it was criticized for the obscurity of its narrative complexity of its interface and difficulty of its puzzles The horror elements were both praised and criticized by different reviews IGN said that the lack of death removed any sense of threat while Zero Punctuation praised the horror but claimed the immersion was broken by the necessity of a walkthrough It received a score of 4913 on GameRankings and 55100 on Metacritic,60.1041754381744,,,,,,

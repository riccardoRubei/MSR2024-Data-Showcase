are revealed for a split second and her last word being a thank you before vanishing for good  Afterwards all of the monsters that were summoned when Zelgius initially placed the red stone in Sophies

everythings vanished and after saying his final farewell he sets himself on fire and disappears into the air They return to the Church to find Winry and Sophies beautiful white cat Norn and decide to have a nice walk in town since they no longer had anything to worry about  On the way through the empty streets Edward is pushed back by Winry as she is deeply immersed in a conversation with Sophie

her name out before she vanishes and realizes that hes alive again reaching out for Sophie  When he turns he sees Sophie sitting with a blank and vacant expression and Winry sobbing uncontrollably by her side He then suddenly realizes that something is wrong and moves to her screaming and touching foreheads together Edward and Alphonse meet Führer Bradley at the Headquarters which turns into a

actually killed him  The three make their way to the top of a skyscraper where Sarranos pod landed Trishka accuses Sarrano of her fathers death but he simply kicks her off the side of the building

time Sarrano leads them through the underground areas of the city encountering radioactive waste and a giant prison Sarrano snidely explains that that shields used to protect the planets surface from its deadly electrical storms created the waste and in turn began to mutate the population of the surface the changes occurred too quickly for most of the surface population to be rescued and thus many of the feral mutants that Grayson has been fighting were more innocent civilians Grayson is furious at this revelation but continues to help Sarrano to reach the remains the Ulysses Aboard Sarrano

friends Grayson manages to break Sarranos control of Ishi and Ishi sacrifices himself to prevent Sarrano from killing Grayson Grayson then impales Sarrano on the wall of a ship As Grayson and Trishka regroup Sarrano performs one final act ejecting Grayson Trishka and several of his men from the ship back onto the planet With the DNA bomb soon to detonate Grayson and Trishka race back to the Ulysses where one escape pod remains unlaunched they are able to board it and escape into low orbit out of range of the DNA bomb when it goes off,79.46799438886545,7.47,9.2,16.94,74.0,1030.0,1224.0

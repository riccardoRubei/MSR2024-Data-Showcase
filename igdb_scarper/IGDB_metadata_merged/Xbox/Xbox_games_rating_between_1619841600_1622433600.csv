expeditions to the surface much to Annas concern and Millers frustration However on one such expedition with Anna they witness a working train running on the surface Before they can follow it they are captured by Hansa soldiers along with a group of people who claim to be from outside of Moscow The Hansa soldiers execute the other prisoners and Artyom is shot and left for dead taking Anna to their

transmissions from all over the world begin to be picked up and Artyom and Anna realise humanity has not gone extinct They escape by stealing one of Hansas locomotives the Aurora with the aid of a defected Hansa train engineer called Yermak  As the train leaves the Spartan Order moves in to retake it and are shocked and confused at Artyom and Annas presence Knowing that Hansa will have all of them put to death for knowing the truth Miller concludes that the Spartans best chance of survival is to flee Moscow Once outside the city he reveals to the others that while many of Russias cities were bombed the war did not end and NATO proceeded to occupy what was left of the nation To prevent NATO from attacking Moscow the Russian leadership decided to secretly jam all communications to make

the Spartans steal water and fuel from the local bandits while obtaining an updated satellite map  As the Spartans continue on their journey Anna begins to cough up blood fearing the cause was

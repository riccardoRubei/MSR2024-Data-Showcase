Crane that he had entrusted his research to Jade who is tasked with delivering it to another scientist named Dr Allen Camden As Crane goes to look for Jade he finds out that the Defense Ministry is

been bitten and pleads with Crane to stop Rais Jade then succumbs to the wound forcing Crane to kill her After killing Rais assistant Tair with his own machete Crane delivers the tissue samples to Dr Camden who believes that he is very close to the cure but needs the rest of Dr Zeres data Crane then finds out that Rais has cut a deal with the GRE in which he will hand over Dr Zeres research data to them in return for extraction from Harran Crane then assaults Rais headquarters filled with infected and battles him atop a skyscraper eventually stabbing Rais in the neck and throwing him off the building He recovers the research data and decides to turn it over to Dr Camden instead of the GRE intending to stay in Harran to help the

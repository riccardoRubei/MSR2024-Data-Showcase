watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellions return Athellion must return to wherever that person is  thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven and then kill him With

heads straight to the Maharajahs treasure vaults where he discovers the mythical Sands of Time safely contained within their Hourglass and the Dagger of Time which he quickly learns can turn back time a short amount When the Prince presents the dagger to his father the traitorous Vizier demands it as payment but is refused by King Sharaman The Persians then continue on their journey to Azad with

as time goes on After a terrific battle in the ascent of the Tower of Dawn they reach the Hourglass and are about to complete their mission when the Prince hesitates suddenly suspicious of what Farahs motives really are Before Farah can convince the Prince otherwise the Vizier confronts the pair and uses his magical powers to trap Farah and the Prince in a tomb  As they wait to die in the tomb Farah tells the Prince who similarly reveals his claustrophobia a story she had never told anyone before about a time when she was little when her mother told her about a secret magic word which would help her escape anything that scared her Kakolookia  As soon as the Prince repeats the word as if by magic the Prince finds himself in a mysterious tunnel which winds down into a dreamlike bathhouse that resembles the magic fountains that the Prince earlier used to increase his health There he meets Farah inviting him to join her bath as they bathe the Prince and Farah finally make love and find comfort in each other amid their perilous situation When the Prince awakens afterwards he finds himself back in the tomb and discovers that the magical cavern was just a dream but he believed that

one guard that had survived named Eddie Burlow who points him to the Lower Corridor Batman reaches the Patient Pacification Chamber where two security guards inform him that escaped inmate Victor

tell Gordon about his daughters involvement in his crimefighting and the outraged Gordon swears that he will find Barbara without Batmans help  Scarecrows Plans Batman tracks the Arkham Knight to an underground tunnel network hoping to learn Barbaras whereabouts from him but instead gets ambushed by him Batman then gives chase to the escaping convoy only to learn that the driver is a decoy using

was held but before Batman can save her Barbara is doused with fear toxin and shoots herself in the head Batman and Alfred Pennyworth are devastated but Alfred convinces Batman to not lose hope for

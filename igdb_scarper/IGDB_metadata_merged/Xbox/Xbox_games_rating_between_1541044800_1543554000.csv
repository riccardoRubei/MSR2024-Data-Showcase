one guard that had survived named Eddie Burlow who points him to the Lower Corridor Batman reaches the Patient Pacification Chamber where two security guards inform him that escaped inmate Victor

tell Gordon about his daughters involvement in his crimefighting and the outraged Gordon swears that he will find Barbara without Batmans help  Scarecrows Plans Batman tracks the Arkham Knight to an underground tunnel network hoping to learn Barbaras whereabouts from him but instead gets ambushed by him Batman then gives chase to the escaping convoy only to learn that the driver is a decoy using

create a device known as the Cloudburst but Stagg tried to doublecross them and has been doused with fear toxin as punishment After reaching Scarecrow and interrogating Stagg Batman is again exposed to the toxin which triggers a powerful hallucinogenic response Scarecrow escapes with the Cloudburst Batman receives a message from Scarecrow revealing that Barbara is in the same safehouse where Ivy was held but before Batman can save her Barbara is doused with fear toxin and shoots herself in the head Batman and Alfred Pennyworth are devastated but Alfred convinces Batman to not lose hope for

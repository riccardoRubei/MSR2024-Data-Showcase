agendas At the heart of Panchaea Jensen first confronts Zhao Yun Ru when she tries to hijack the signal for her own use then Eliza who offers Jensen four choices Jensen can either broadcast the full truth and distance humanity from augmentations rig the broadcast so it throws suspicion on the Humanity Front and allows further development of augmentation technology send out a report blaming the incident on contaminated Neuropozyne so Taggarts group and by extension the Illuminati find new support or destroy Panchea leaving noone to spin the story Depending on the choice and whether Jensen has taken a pacifist or violent approach through the game his final narration varies  In a postcredits scene Megan meets with Bob Page the main antagonist of Deus Ex to discuss her employment in the

more exciting game features,Unlike the Campaign of its predecessor Battlefield 4s Campaign primarily follows chronological order and permanently casts the player as Recker In the beginning set in Baku Azerbaijan Tombstone Squadconsisting of Recker Dunn Irish and Pacescapes the city with vital intelligence in hand and Russian special forces in hot pursuit The squad winds up trapped in a civilians car when it plunges into the sea Dunn trapped between the seats and critically wounded gives Recker his pistol and orders him to shoot out the windshield35 Reluctantly Recker shoots the window and Dunn drowns as the others escape As Tombstone swims to the surface the player hears their commanding officer Captain Garrison talking over the phone about the intel that Admiral Chang is planning a military coup détat and if he succeeds he will gain full Russian support confirming an earlier report from an asset in China Tombstone returns to the USS Valkyrie an amphibious assault carrier en route to Chinas eastern coast On board Garrison informs them of the assassination of Chinese presidential candidate Jin Jié and that Chang convinced the Chinese that the United States was responsible Garrison sends Tombstone with Recker as squad leader on a covert mission in Shanghai to rescue three VIPs Kovic Hannah and Hannahs husband With Tombstones help Kovic takes his fellow VIPs to the Valkyrie by helicopter Meanwhile Tombstone takes a civilian tourist boat from the shore just as an electromagnetic pulse fries all electric equipment in the area Realizing that there are other civilian refugees stranded on boats around them and against Pacs protests Irish leads them to the Valkyrie Aboard the Valkyrie they head for the USS Titan a Nimitzclass aircraft carrier that can assist them Upon sighting the Titan the Valkyrie finds it highly damaged by Changs Chinese military Garrison orders Tombstone with Kovic as acting squad leader Recker lost the position because he didnt stop Irish in Shanghai to scour the wreckage of the Titan for vital intelligence before it sinks Tombstone recovers a hard drive with data from before the Chinese missile attack and fight their way out against boarding Chinese soldiers The Titan buckles under its own weight while sinking and splits in two forcing Tombstone to jump ship Making their way back to the Valkyrie with a hijacked assault boat they find the carrier under siege by Chinese forces They board it to repel the Chinese assault Kovic is critically injured during the engagement and puts Recker back in charge of Tombstone before he dies Tombstone then clears the bridge and rescues Hannahs husband and Garrison Garrison debriefs Recker and Pac on the upcoming assault on the Chinesecontrolled Singapore airfield to destroy Chinese air superiority while their air forces are grounded by a storm Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone much to Irishs chagrin as he wasnt involved in the debrief himself They successfully assault the beach and lead an advance towards the airfield losing most of their forces in the process While crossing a bridge to the airfield Recker is pinned behind by a car blown by the strong winds and tries to break free with the help of Tombstone to no avail A large freighter crashes into the bridge throwing Tombstone into the sea below They survive and make their way to the airfield via a sewer After Pac fires the signal flare Tombstone attempts to evacuate the area using an enemy vehicle but they are knocked out of their vehicle when the missiles hit apparently killing Pac Hannah seemingly betrays the squad bringing the Chinese soldiers to capture Tombstone this infuriates Irish but neither he nor Recker can stop the soldiers from incapacitating them Recker and Irish are then taken to a prison in the Kunlun Mountains by the Chinese military There the two Marines are interrogated about their mission in Shanghai with Chang personally watching before being thrown into cells Recker is awoken by Dima a Russian prisoner suffering from radiation poisoning Recker helps Dima release the other prisoners starting a mass riot throughout the prison and reuniting him with Irish Although the prison guard is overrun Chinese military arrive and launch an assault Recker and Irish hold them off long enough for Dima to open the prison gates only to be caught by Hannah and other soldiers Hannah shoots the soldiers holding Recker Irish and Dima at gunpoint she explains that she had been tasked to protect Jin Jié who had been posing as her husband The group fight their way through the Kunlun Mountains to a cable car which goes down the mountain The tram is then shot down by an enemy helicopter and the impact kills Dima Forced to continue on foot for two days Tombstone makes their way down the mountain forced to hunt for food to survive They find a jeep and drive to Tashgar under siege by both Chinese and Russian forces While driving Hannah explains that shed brought Jin Jié to meet her family to give them hope but that the next day Changs army came and killed them all this mortifies Irish and he apologizes to Hannah They eventually find Major Greenland who commands the remainder of US ground forces in Tashgar She states that the mobile antiair that the Russians have are causing them to have a disadvantage Tombstone volunteers to demolish

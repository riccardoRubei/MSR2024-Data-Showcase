math problems It is not a simple game in terms of difficulty nor is it intended but the easy level will be accessible to everyone,"[5, 9, 13, 14, 32]",Earth July 2156  Sandra had been out of the room where she worked for three weeks straight on the east coast of New Zealand She was focused on his research into a new genomic model for species adapted to environments that could be susceptible to exist on Earth within the period of five hundred to a billion years Her genetic research on adaptability of life to the environment and her conclusions were definitely unreliable She would have to look for better alternatives The most promising thing she had was focusing on birds no doubt Adapting some of them combining their DNA with that of other species promised to give more hopeful results  She was absorbed in these thoughts when a signal sounded It was an incoming call She accepted it The number was known And unexpected But somehow she felt the need to know what that was about  Well if its Jan my personal admirer Hi Sandra how are you I have not heard from you in a while Im dressed this time for your misfortune That fixes easily There are Irenka and the children You could undress again I liked the show Not in your best dreams He laughed She added How is Irenka And the children Irenka is getting prettier every day And the children ask me about you Sandra sighed I cannot go all I want Jan You can come home taking the necessary precautions Bring the children But I cannot go I cant do that You know if they find me if they know Im an android  I know But it is not fair Together we have worked very well these years That explains it to the GSA They continue with their android control campaign You already know his motto Men will never be slaves Androids will never stop being  Something happened to you three years ago Something you do not want to tell me Sandra nodded slightly Thats right Jan I do not want to tell you Jan insisted What happened to you up there Sandra Youve been very changed ever since You got me worried Irenka feels the same I could tell you But then I would have to kill you You are very funny Jan never knew that actually it was not a joke Sandra continued Well I imagine its not a courtesy call Its another of your jobs Jan nodded It is We sent one of our operatives to Saturns moon Titan as part of the Gamma team for the math competition at the Titan Deep Space Company I had to do  a job Sandras face twisted What That madness Thats not a sport Jan Its a monstrosity But you know the money you make in bets And all that this entails it is white selling arms and drugs and other things I know too well And the company I prefer not to speak Why The Titan Deep Space Company malfunctioned for a while until its former chief executive Richard Tsakalidis regained control Do you know him Ive read something Sandra lied But lets focus Are you asking me by chance to go to Titan That fucking space station where that stupid math tournament is held That Math Combat Challenge Exactly Our agent has disappeared The last contact was three days ago No one has seen him since He had to send us data about a group of white traffickers and traffickers who organized the gambling business at the companys space station Weve been behind them for two years We wanted to gather conclusive evidence during the maths championship Thats not a math championship Jan Thats a massacre Well theres math during the tournament Do not be sarcastic Im not Listen I know I owe you more than one favor And more than three I know Will you help me Ill give you whatever you want in return Sandra hesitated for a moment Anything Of course A weekend with the children on excursion They and I alone Jan opened his eyes What Thats not a request Thats a blessing And you take Irenka to some pretty place You have abandoned her for your work Sandra weve already talked about it Shut up You will do it Agree I will make the sacrifice of leaving the children with Aunt Sandra for a weekend Its okay Ill be right out Give me all the facts of the case Be careful Sandra please They say that that area the deep space beyond Jupiter is crazy Trade routes are taken by pirates and security sold to the highest bidder Every news is worse than the last Look whos talkingBecause of you I have almost blown my head twice But youve always managed to get through it The shots do To hold you is another matter Goodbye Jan And remember the covenant  Sandra took the first ship to Titan On this occasion she did not stop at Mars because the planet was in opposition to Saturn She was glad of it Sh didnt want to remember the events that happened on the planet three years ago There began a nightmare of which she would not want to remember anything But her programming prevented her from hiding memories It was part of her design In this way the android obtained an experience positive sometimes negative others and could not remain alone with the good which gave more character to the artificial personality  She felt some anxiety about that trip All the anguish that can feel an android of infiltration and combat model QCS60 advanced Her quantum computer had ceased to be what it had been originally long ago when she intervened in the unfortunate Operation Folkvangr The accumulation of experiences and the many events lived in the last hundred and seven years had transformed her radically And back to Titan where she had been about to die three years ago during that crisis with that damn ship they had finished modeling her with a new personality Harder colder but also more stable In many respects very little remained of the original android Maybe nothing  The transport left her on Titan the satellite of Saturn that was an almost inexhaustible source of hydrocarbons for the solar system and which exploited exclusively the Titan Deep Space Company Sandra stayed in a hotel not far from the base where three years before she was first leader and then prisoner The hotel had a shuttle to the space station where the sports competition known as the Math Combat Challenge was held That barbarity was the favorite sport of the solar system It was basically a huge stadium on a huge space station where participants had to solve various math problems of all kinds Gigantic virtual panels showed various mathematical exercises and participants had to find the right numbers moving through the stadium or shoot the solution if it was in a group of possible answers  The peculiarity of this sport was however very peculiar it was based on the fact that these exercises had to be solved in the midst of countless traps that were happening in the stadium in addition to an endless chain of attacks of all kinds of elements Only occasional help was available for a birdshaped dron Beyond that the motto of the competition was to count and to survive The winners made a fortune Losers lost everything including of course life They could retire before they perished But few did  Titan Deep Space Company sponsored the game with which it made even more money than its industry and also allowed it to launder some of the profits made in ways not too neat The president of the company Richard Tsakalidis had disappeared three years ago during the crisis that Sandra suffered on Titan only to appear by surprise a year later seemingly without remembering anything of the happened thing and taking back its position The Board of Directors immediately readmitted him for many and varied reasons that it was better not to remember  Sandra settled into her room after rejecting a couple of proposals she had had from a couple of men who had invited her into her room without even inviting her to a previous drink something too common in her daily life It was put in underwear with slippers and activated the holographic emitter of sports where they were emitted images of the competition It was at that moment that the image of the projector was transformed Then came a figure that was clear and bitterly recognized  Richard How Hello Sandra Glad to see you in good condition As beautiful as always Those blue eyes are awesome And that set you up very well Where were you And where is Scott Is he still kidnapped Youve always asked too many questions Lets say Scott is now a valuable and effective partner And lets say that I continue with my firm and clear objectives but that you already know What I want to know is what youre doing here Thats none of your business Richard Or Zeus as you like to be called I did not like it but in the end its looking good I even added the image of Zeus to the companys new logo You must know that everything that happens on Titan is my business I saw that you bought an entry for the Math Combat Challenge Do you want me to get you a front row seat Or are you going to participate as a math fighter Go to hell Richard Oh yeah Hell people send me there with some frequency In any case Ill be watching you Sandra After what happened between us I have a deep wound in my heart You hurt me I I gave it all for you I offered you an empire And you paid for it by betraying me Youll have a good wound in the heart when I tear it to pieces you pig Im sorry Sandra You take this too personally especially considering that you are nothing but a pile of scrap metal All this is business Simple business And in these businesses youre either with me or youre against me And you are in the second group It boils down to that In any case Ill finish by finding out what brought you here I assure How did you find me so fast  There was no answer The image was cut At that moment the door sounded Not with the bell but with the classic knuckle touch Sandra sighed wondering who it would be She opened the door On the other side of the door appeared a man of about forty years and a cloudy look He stood erect and silent Sandra asked Who are you Jan sent you here to look for an operative from her investigating agency that has disappeared didnthe Sandra felt the world fall on her First Richard discovered it when he arrived Now that man knew perfectly well why he was there She answered How do you know that Very easy Sandra It turns out that I am that operative ,Missing,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

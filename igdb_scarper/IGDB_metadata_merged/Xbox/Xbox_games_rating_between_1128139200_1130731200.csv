and Cthulhu that holds the whole town under its grip The building proves unbreachable for the Coast Guard and the Marines but Jack finds a way in through an old smuggling entrance guarded by a starspawn of Cthulhu Inside Jack frees Agent Mackey who has been kidnapped for a ritual sacrifice and puts down the magical shield protecting the building After discovering a secret chamber he falls through the floor of a tunnel which leads into the sea Jack is rescued by the USS Urania a Coast Guard cutter which is part of a group heading to Devils Reef on February 10 following up on a lead provided by the FBI On the way there wizards on the reef summon powerful tidal waves to destroy the flotilla but Jack commandeers the ships cannon and kills them The humanoid fishmen known as Deep Ones launch a massed attack on the Urania killing most of the crew and disabling the engines Jack manages to reactivate the engine only to have the gigantic Father Dagon himself attack him on the bow Jack manages to defeat the demigod with the cannon but not before it causes the Urania to sink Jack survives the encounter and finds himself on Devils Reef where he discovers old smuggling tunnels beneath the seabed leading him to the underwater city of Yhanthlei The city is found to be located below Devils Reef and is the home of the Deep Ones and members of the Order Navy submarines attempt to torpedo Yhanthlei but are stopped by a magical barrier protecting the city The Temple of Dagon is the source of the barrier but the entrance is sealed off to prevent any interference Jack finds

of the Great Race of Yith Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra whose song is generating the barrier by deafening some of the Deep Ones to her song allowing him to take control of them With the barrier down the submarines attack the city while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Orders headquarters In the end it is revealed that a Yithian swapped minds with Jack Walters father during the moment of Jacks conception In flesh Jack Walters is human but he inherited Yithian psychic powers which was the reason for the cultists interest in him and explains why he has visions of coming danger and of the Yithian librarycity of Pnakotus as well as his ability to control Deep Ones in the Temple of Dagon Confined back into Arkham Asylum Jack hangs himself on February 16 1922 unable to handle the reality of himself and what he has witnessed The game is supposed to be based on the

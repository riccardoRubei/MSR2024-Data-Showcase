0,274982,Super Mario Bros HF,[18],Hello there Youre probably here because youre looking for a fun hack of Super Mario Bros right If so Super Mario Bros HF could be just for you Perhaps the main focus of SMBHF is the difficulty Most hacks that redo levels at least the ones that Ive tried make the game nearly impossible Ive had quite a few games where I couldnt get past the first few levels without savestates In my opinion games like these are just not fun How can you enjoy a game if you have to keep saving after each major jump I dont think you can  That is why SMBHFs levels are about as difficult as the original games You will NOT find ultrahard levels in SMBHF if you can beat Super Mario Bros you can beat SMBHF These levels were created for the gamers enjoyment not for the gamers frustration Each level 11 through 84 has been changed Some have been changed moreso than others but each has been significantly altered  The lesser focus of SMBHF is graphic changing Some major graphic changes include New floor tile New underwater tile New  blocks New brick graphics Borrowed from SMB2J and others There are also some minor graphic changes that you may notice throughout the game And yes those lines on Marios face are longer sideburns,Missing,Missing,Missing,,,,,,

chased by abominable creatures created by their principal Some of them survived that terrible night while others perished Now the survivors have picked up the pieces of their lives and gone to college  But all is not right at Fallcreek University strange flowers suddenly appear everywhere on the campus flowers that contain a dangerous substance that induces strange but vivid dreams A handful of students learn that the flowers are far more dangerous than they seem When the seeds finally sprout nightmare suddenly turns into horrifying reality,The story is set two years after the Leafmore Incident the events of the first Obscure The Leafmore incident has been somehow coveredup Shannon and Kenny are now enrolled in the nearby Fallcreek University while Stan is reforming his life as a delivery truck driver Stan and Kenny have to take medication to prevent the effects of the plant from infecting their bodies while Shannon has been able to adapt to the changes  As the story begins a new drug created from a strange flower is quickly spreading its influence over the Universitys populace Soon enough a small group of students along with the Leafmore High survivors have to face a horde of mutants and try to stay alive  The spores spread through the whole city and later the whole country The outbreak starts in a fraternity party of the ΔΘГ brotherhood Amy and Kenny are the first ones to arrive only to find the place infected when they get inside The students then meet a scientist Richard James who is the biology teacher of the university who aids the player several times After some time the group is joined by Corey and Mei who try to escape  Once outside Sven is almost run over by someone driving Coreys car so Corey and Amy chase the car thief into the woods Meanwhile Mei who gets a call from her twin sister Jun goes with Sven to rescue her but fails as Jun is killed by a monster  The duo finds Coreys car however its owner gets angry and along with Amy kills the now mutated thief After some more walking they notice a disfigured man fight some new monsters Harpies and walk through the forest to eventually end up in the Fallcreek University Hospital where they find Shannon and her brother Kenny the latter of whom is badly ill due to sniffing the drug made by the black spore flower He cant find his medicine and eventually succumbs turning into a monster  Then the whole group reunites in the hospitals east ground floor where they make a chemical dynamite to destroy a wall and get to the parking lot Sven and Corey help everyone to get into a warehouse but they are surprised by a monstrous Kenny who throws Corey into a pole and kills Mei greatly distressing Corey Stan having responded to Kennys call before mutating meets with the surviving group and drives them away until he crashes off and falls into a dam Shannon and Stan explore the Dam and the whole group finally reunites to find Amy in a corner of the room  After locating Amy they find that this was as a result of Kennys actions who implied that he raped her The group escapes but Corey and Shannon stay and defeat him by making him fall into a pit with a giant metal apparatus falling onto him  As the game progresses Stan and Shannon eventually get closer Whilst they find a place to take refuge Amy and Sven explore and are ambushed by a man with a disfigured face carrying a chainsaw The disfigured man fights Sven to allow Amy to escape  When they find Sven impaled on a meat hook by the disfigured man at an abandoned house Stan and Shannon chase after the disfigured man leading to the ruins of the school from the first game and a tree with huge moving branches The huge tree was actually the mutated remains of Leonard Friedman from Obscure whilst the disfigured man is his son Jedidiah Friedman had injected himself with a strain of virus that mutated him which was then passed on to Jedidiah Stan and Corey kill the Friedman tree while Corey finishes off Jedidiah avenging Svens death  When the pair return they find Richard and an ambulance carrying a pregnant Amy Stan and Corey find out that the fraternity Delta Theta Gamma is not just a normal college fraternity but an ancient and powerful organization that wants to harness the power of the Mortifilla The ambulance takes Stan Shannon Amy and Corey away but they crash at a bridge after going through

ride is stopped by a yet living and more powerful Monster Kenny Corey decides to fight Kenny but the fight doesnt last as Kenny manages to infect Corey  When Shannon and Stan reach the new destination point they see Corey just as he is infected prior to the entry of Stan and Shannon on his knees He states that Mei was the only one he cared about then commits suicide Stan and Shannon kill Kenny by crushing him with a huge platform of lights over the football pitch  As Kenny lies dying under the platform he pleads to Shannon to take care of his child however Shannon swears that she will not let it live The helicopter containing Amy and Richard fills up with a cloud of spores before it explodes Stan asks Shannon what to do next she replies that she will continue on and cut all family ties as well as stopping the Delta Theta Gamma organization,75.84766225525635,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

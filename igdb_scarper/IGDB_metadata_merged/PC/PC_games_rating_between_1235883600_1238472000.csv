Shop,A Fanciful and Sinister Imagination  Taborea was born when Ayvenas began recording his visions of an extraordinary world in a book As he wrote the god created peaceful races and idyllic lands for them to inhabit But as we all know a happy story is a boring story so one day he had a thought that would prove very dangerous indeed  What if the story werent so peaceful  This insidious thought so consumed him that he began painting Taborea in a darker palette of colours Wise men became fools gentle elves developed brutal tendencies and gracious dwarves were spoilt with greed Even the provisions intended to protect the creatures of Taborea were twisted and corrupted  Ayvenas recognised the gravity of his interference in a world no longer under his control so he decided to let the Taboreans write their own ending to the story He tore the unwritten pages into pieces and scattered them across the land  and thus began a new era  Triumph and the Danger of Power  After Ayvenas withdrawal Taborea was besieged by the vicious Naga Humans and Elves combined forces and using the elven sword Arclight among other weapons the allies were able fend off the serpentine assailants and confine them within a magical barrier  Inspired by their great triumph the peoples of Taborea founded the old kingdoms in order to impart their knowledge to others The Humans were most interested in the runes and in the scattered pieces of Ayvenas book because according to legend these oracles could be used to control the future and determine history  However as the humans learned more their thirst for knowledge and power took on dangerous proportions Intoxicated with greed and aided by arcane magic some of them transformed into terrible demons and began the greatest massacre in the history of Taborea the War of Balanzasar Once again an alliance was needed in order to restore the peace which they accomplished by banishing many demons to the Void they had created to contain them  The Rise and Fall of the Guardians  The alliance prevailed but there was a heavy toll Many were killed and their knowledge died with them The Humans in particular had lost most of their power over the runes But the little that remained was enough to create mighty guardians who would protect them from the last of the demons  Before long though Taborea needed protection from these protectors The guardians threatened not only the demons but the entire world at large Only the dragons were strong enough to face them but their battle ended abruptly when the guardians suddenly fell silent  In the Age of Punishment the peoples of Taborea were in a constant state of fear They lost their knowledge their culturebut not their courage The Humans who dared to start anew left for the continent of Kolydia while those who stayed behind were hardened into a race of barbarians The Elves fled to the continent of Candara  A Race Divided by an Ancient Curse  On Candara the Elves were able to escape the guardians  but not the Curse of the Elven Twins According to an ancient legend a pair of twins would create a great schism amongst the elven folk This prophecy came to pass once when the Elves fought against the demons  And history seemed doomed to repeat itself when a second pair of twins was born to the royal family In order to finally break the curse one of the twins Kentailon decided to leave his home for the good of his people But the rift was unavoidable The queen couldnt bear to see Kentailon go off alone so she followed her son into the unknown  The Adventures of Sigaylas  While the elder brother Yabisan ascended the elven throne Kentailon roamed the continent travelling all the way to the magical barrier surrounding the Naga  It was here that the elven twin now calling himself Sigaylas fell in love and found true happiness  until the attack of the Cyclopes which devastated the land In desperation Sigaylas tore the elven sword Arclight from the barrier and with it sent the Cyclopes running  Although the oneeyed beasts had been defeated an even greater danger was awakened Sigaylas had released the Naga There was only one hope left for the Elves the Humans So once again these two races waged war on the formidable Naga hordes  The Allure of the Past  The harrowing struggle with the Naga and then the prosperity which ensued caused people to forget about the past Only organisations such as the Eye of Wisdom were interested in delving deeply into Taboreas history  The investigations of the Eye of Wisdom in Kolydia revealed intriguing evidence of secrets which drew the organisation ever closer to the Elves on Candara And that brings us to the beginning of our time  an age of discovery,60.04495469786229,0.0,35.0,0.0,60.0,9.0,1.0

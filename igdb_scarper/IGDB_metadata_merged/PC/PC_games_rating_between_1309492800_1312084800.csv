gives an illusion of depth However despite the fact that Medivia Online is a 2D game it has a third dimension as well creating an effect of different floors in a 2D world  Players on Medivia Online are currently allowed to choose one of four professions they will play during the journey in a mystery medieval world full of beauty and magic,In the beginning there were four Brothers Each one of them obsessed with the desire of creation wanted to shape the world in their own way After a countless time of void they all agreed to create one world and share everything between themselves  The First Brother created fire from which emerged a burning barren land The surface was hot and thick smoke eclipsed the whole sky In these flames he called himself Gnashal and his fiery spirit began to circle over the land feeding on evil lurking inside  The Second Brother formed stone and spread it all over the land His grounds were hard and solid full of power and greatness In this rock he carved his name Talkatan and soon after that he took his first step on his newly created land The Third Brother despised the look of the land so he filled all the remaining space with a humongous ocean From horizon to horizon the only thing he could see was the infinity of undisturbed water From that arose a mighty father of the oceans known as Malaloth  The Fourth Brother Magin refused to divide the land Rather than sharing he used his powers to spread his energy through the air Magic was created A mystical power without purpose rose above the flames water and stone Wherever it appeared it distorted everything It raged the oceans softened the lands and dimmed the fire  When the other brothers saw this they became very displeased with his actions and decided to destroy the magic once and for all by hiding everything deep within the ground Within a short period of time Gnashal used all of his power and the fire within the ground suddenly burned like never before The earth erupted with huge living flames destroying everything it encountered on its path Fiery smoke reached high in the air and demolished the magic on every height possible Then Malaloth controlled his water to ruffle and shout The calm oceans began to form whirls powerful currents and soon the whole magic presence above the water was dispersed The final bit of the destruction was carried out by Talkatan He used his power to evoke strong earthquakes The earth was rising and falling creating canyons caves mountains and valleys Finally all of them managed to trap the magic deep beneath the surface of the land  The three brothers satisfied with their victory did not even notice how their actions had changed the world The burned earth gave birth to volcanoes holes and lava rivers The hard rock grew into mountains dry rivers and valleys and the water began to rage and crash into the shores of all the lands  After several centuries the remaining Three Brothers fell into a deep sleep While they were asleep secretly from the fire 11 Great Demons rose They were the first beings younger than the brothers themselves and although they were not equal to their fathers they were extremely powerful Jealous Talkatan awoken from his sleep powered his stone to become alive 7 powerful leviathans opened their eyes When Malaloth saw his brothers work he reached all the way to the bottom of the ocean and threw away a horde of creatures Among them were serpents snakes and other powerful predators living underwater He also released a handful of birds that immediately began to fly high above the ocean  These ancient beings rapidly bred their own servants At this time the Three Brothers realized that they were no longer the only creatures that had the ability to create and command their elements to disappear fall or descend They no longer had power over them Knowing this they decided to destroy their creations just like they did with their fourth brother After a long time of brutal and bloody fights the Brothers fell All three world powers roared victoriously knowing that from now on they had the whole world just for themselves  The three forces of the early world quickly realized that their own land was not enough for them The smaller demons eventually began to venture further and further into the land of rock and earth shaping it into their own liking Underwater creatures swam closer and closer to the shores of the other lands Eventually Leviathan Torgorath wishing to defend his own land smashed one of the demons with his tusk and unleashed what they now call the First War  Once more the three elements clashed in a monstrous battle between themselves much longer and more destructive than before The boundaries between the Lands began to collapse Elements fighting each other began to fuse together Between lands and water formed sands and grasslands which soon Basilisks Snakes Great Spiders and all the animals inhabited The area of hard rock began to grow unknown plants trees shrubs and the fire made materials to be harder and nobler than earth and rock  The war lasted for more than four centuries During this period the earth began to change more and more causing a series of everincreasing changes in the structure of the earth Finally the world had enough During one of the giant clashes the foundations of the world were heavily affected leading to the First Cataclysm A huge explosion broke out in one of the largest mountains The force that freed from the earth swept most of the creatures from the ground and levelled the volcanoes and hills The greatest of the monsters and demons managed to withstand long enough to bury themselves deep underground but most of their servants did not resist the power of the world trying to escape annihilation  A giant explosion destroyed a piece of the earths surface revealing the magic that was hidden underneath for hundreds of years Then Varazin emerged from beneath the surface An entity much more powerful than everyone else made of pure magic with four wings and a humanlike body floating in peace and stillness over the immensity of the purifying world  As soon as the cataclysm came to an end Varazin created his servants Rather than making them out of himself he took one part of each of the existing elements and formed the first Humans  The early humans nowadays called the Ancients quickly made their mark on the world They did not belong to any of the elements neither did they understand all the previous conflicts and therefore they did not pay attention to the fact that they are changing the world and even more  they enjoyed it At the beginning of their existence the rest of the still existing demons and other entities offered help They taught people how to start a fire extract minerals and use water Everyone wanted to gain a mighty ally in times of war People used their teachings but they never fully trusted them The Ancients considered them strange and evil beings  Eventually the monsters stood together before the council of already very numerous people and demanded an answer  who will they decide to serve The answer of the Ancients was  nobody  The war between Ancients and monsters was abundant in death and loss Ancients were much stronger and mightier than todays people They handled weapons of extraordinary quality and a great size with ease and crafted powerful armors which despite their thickness were very light and agile However they had no chance against the monsters that still remembered the beginning of this world Ancients were losing soldiers quickly They would lose the war eventually if it was not for Varazins Sacrifice As humanity began to fall the sofar neutral Varazin had arisen above all the rocks mountains and clouds The battle stopped as both the ancients and monsters looked in the sky shocked not knowing what would happen next Then a sudden surge of enormous energy appeared in the sky and in a blink of an eye everything exploded It was Varazin who had destroyed himself giving people his last gift  magic This powerful release of energy triggered the Second Cataclysm That eventually sealed the shelters of demons and other powerful creatures Although the ancients were also affected by the cataclysm they managed to survive though this did cost them a lot of effort and power,Missing,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

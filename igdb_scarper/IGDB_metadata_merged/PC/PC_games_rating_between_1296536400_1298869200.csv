by Grayson Hunt Steven Blum having been following Sarranos orders in assassinating what they believe are drug traffickers and mass murderers kill a man known as Bryce Novak but soon discover he was a civilian reporter having documented other civilian deaths caused by Dead Echo Grayson and his team realize they have been duped by Sarrano and go AWOL becoming space pirates on the run from Sarranos forces now going by the name Final Echo  Ten years later Graysons team tries to flee from Sarranos battlecruiser the Ulysses while near the planet of Stygia With their ships systems failing Grayson in a drunken stupor orders the crew to ram at the Ulysses hoping to gain revenge on Sarraro The ships collide forcing both down and causing them to crash land on the surface of Stygia One of Graysons men Ishi Sato Andrew Kishino is critically wounded in the crash and Grayson is forced to find an energy cell to drive the ships medical equipment On the planet a former popular tropicallike resort destination the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants Grayson fights through to one of the Ulysses escape pods where a Final Echo soldier succumbs to a horde of mutants After dispatching the attackers Grayson retrieves the escape pods energy cell as well as an instinct leash that when worn begins to provide him strange tactile information such as points for each enemy he kills  Grayson returns with the cell and while Ishi is under operation the mutants attack their ship The operation is cut short by an explosion during battle leaving Ishi a disfigured cyborg Grayson and Ishi the only survivors decide to work together to get off the planet despite Ishis disapproval of Graysons thirst for revenge The instinct leash leads Grayson to another escape pod where they find Trishka Jennifer Hale another Final Echo soldier who agrees to work with Grayson and Ishi but only after they rescue Sarrano As they battle through the ravaged city Trishka explains that Stygia has been used by Final Echo as a sort of training grounds with the instinct leashes the soldiers wear as a means of ranking those within the test those that scored kills would be the only ones that could get ammunition and other supplies to survive When Grayson learns that Trishka was Novaks daughter he tells her that Sarrano was responsible for her fathers death but claims he does not know who actually killed him  The three make their way to the top of a skyscraper where Sarranos pod landed Trishka accuses Sarrano of her fathers death but he simply kicks her off the side of the building Sarrano then warns Grayson and Ishi that there is an armed DNA bomb on the Ulysses that will wipe out all life on the planet and that they must go and disarm it as his rescue ship will not arrive in time Sarrano leads them through the underground areas of the city encountering radioactive waste and a giant prison Sarrano snidely explains that that shields used to protect the planets surface from its deadly electrical storms created the waste and in turn began to mutate the population of the surface the changes occurred too quickly for most of the surface population to be rescued and thus many of the feral mutants that Grayson has been fighting were more innocent civilians Grayson is furious at this revelation but continues to help Sarrano to reach the remains the Ulysses Aboard Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi once again having them actually arm the DNA bomb while his rescue ship will arrive in time to save him As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship the two are saved by Trishka who survived the fall by catching a power line on her way down  The three race to where Sarranos rescue ship is landing and manage to get on board They make their way through Sarranos elite troops and eventually face Sarrano alone Trishka demands to know who actually killed her father to which Sarrano indicts Grayson In the confusion Sarrano hijacks Ishis computer systems forcing him to turn on his friends Grayson manages to break Sarranos control of Ishi and Ishi sacrifices himself to prevent Sarrano from killing Grayson Grayson then impales Sarrano on the wall of a ship As Grayson and Trishka regroup Sarrano performs one final act ejecting Grayson Trishka and several of his men from the ship back onto the planet With the DNA bomb soon to detonate Grayson and Trishka race back to the

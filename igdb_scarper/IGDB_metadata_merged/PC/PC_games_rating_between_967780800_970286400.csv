that known by Waldo Carney Sacred Trusts accountant who was trying to flee the city When his zeppelin was attacked by Black Hats the Fortune Hunters were able to rescue him and transport him safely to police HQ    Convinced their secrets had been revealed Sacred Trust attempted to flee the city loading their remaining contraband and documents onto zeppelins However the Fortune Hunts and Blake Aviation Security were able to disable their zeppelins as well as the stolen Spruce Goose and prevent Sacred Trust from removing the vital evidence    Furious at these repeated defeats the true master behind both the Black Hats and Sacred Trust revealed himself  Lucas Miles the man who had betrayed the Fortune Hunters in Cuba In his mighty zeppelin Dante Miles attempted to flee but his zeppelin and his fighters were no match for the combined force of the Fortune Hunters and Blake Aviation Security The Dante was shot down and Miles was killed    Victorious once again the Fortune Hunters accepted

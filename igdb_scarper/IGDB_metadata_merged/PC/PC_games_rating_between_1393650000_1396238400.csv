diplomacy with rival powers However new to III is the greater addition of roleplaying game features where players must first choose and customize their leader all options dependant on the players chosen style of play There are six available races in the initial release humans draconians high elves dwarves orcs and goblins all that will determine the race of their empire with each having unique perks and abilities The leader and empire is further shaped by the choice from skill sets based on traditional RPG classes along with further specializations and skills to select Each leader class also has access to their own unique units with a distinct visual look based on their corresponding race each to accommodate their own unique approach to strategy both in combat and when managing their empire On release there are six different classes a leader can be The Sorcerer class emphasizes the use of magic for enchantments and summoning powerful units The Theocrat derives from an organized religion based society including zealots followers and the use of holy spells and warriors The Rogue favors less direct approaches to situations employing stealth thievery and manipulation aswell as dark magic in diplomacy and warfare The Archdruid channels the power of nature using it to their advantage by being very selfsufficient and being able to call upon wild creatures The Dreadnaught leads a steampunk styled society using large industry machinery and gunpowderbased units like cannons and tanks Finally the Warlord specializes in direct conflict and combat tactics utilizing effective nonmagic based units and abilities Leaders themselves and separate recruitable hero units will be able to gain experience and level up while also being able to gain new equipment and powers Players

Units that come from an unaffiliated city will fight to protect a citys domain and they wont forget that theyre tied to it Many of these independent settlements arent cities in the traditional sense but can be alternative settlements like a Giants Keep for example The player can conquer these holdings which will provide units like a city or they can absorb them through diplomatic means by paying tribute and diplomatic andor alignment standing Quests can also be given to players by independent forces and cities including but not limited to clearing out wild units searching for relics and even conquering cities and other holdings Quests can grant the support of independent forces for player in addition to a reward such as gold or equipment sometimes with the choice of either given to the player upon completion of the quest As in the case of the first game in the series Age of Wonders III offers a storydriven campaign that is playable from two sides the humancentric Commonwealth Empire and the Court of the High Elves In addition to the campaign singleplayer scenarios online multiplayer random map generation and a map editor are also available The graphics of Age of Wonders III will be presented in 3D instead of the isometric view the series has utilized up to this point,Before the events of the first game the elven court was decimated by humans an invasive race new to the Blessed Continent at the time The elves split into two factions The son of the slain king Inioch Meandor led the dark elves and the Cult of Storms a group that intended to wipe out the humans Iniochs daughter Julia led the wood elves and the Keepers a group that had no genocidal intentions These factions and others clashed in the Valley of Wonders around the ruins of the razed elven court The High Elf race was founded many years later when Julia married a dark elf and reunited their two races Meanwhile the Commonwealth Empire began as a joining of races for mutual protection and the sharing of knowledge Though it set out with benign intentions once the Empire was through expanding humans seized power and pushed forward with technology and commerce The Commonwealth Empire means to sweep aside the old ways and assimilate the world The Elven Court takes exception to this and wants to rally the ancient races to stand in defense against imperial ambitions hence the central conflict of

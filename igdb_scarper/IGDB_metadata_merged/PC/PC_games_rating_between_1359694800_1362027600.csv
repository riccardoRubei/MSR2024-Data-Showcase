in them CELL transfers Prophet to a facility in New York encased within a giant Nanodome to skin him He is saved by a resistance force led by Claire Fontanelli and Karl Ernst Rasch as Prophet is the only Nanosuit holder left who can stop CELL Psycho who was saved by Claire after being skinned explains to Prophet that during his absence CELL used Ceph technology to generate unlimited energy and gained a monopoly over the worlds power supply Those who could not pay for energy were enslaved by debt to CELL The source of CELLs power generation for the entire world called System X is located in now abandoned New York The resistance group wants System X destroyed to free the world from CELL  After Psycho and Prophet disable System Xs core it turns out that it is a system protocol designed to contain the Alpha Ceph while draining energy off of the alien However the secondary defense protocol was initiated causing the power facility to selfdestruct The Alpha Ceph free from containment opens a wormhole to the Ceph homeworld They plan to send an even larger force to invade Earth through the wormhole and terraform it at the expense of all local lifes extinction With the Alpha Ceph no longer dormant the Ceph coordinator reactivates and a coordinated Ceph attack ensues  After unlocking his potential ability by removing some neural blocks in his suit Prophet learns that CELL plans to use Archangel a satellitebased energy distribution device that can draw power from the worlds power grid as a directed energy weapon to destroy the Alpha Ceph Firing it would cause a chain reaction that would destroy Earth They shut off the weapon before it has enough energy to fire Along the way Psycho discovers Claire was one of the scientists who reluctantly skinned him causing friction in his previously romantic relationship with her Unfortunately Karl who had secretly used Ceph technology to extend his lifespan is possessed by the Ceph and critically wounds Claire while psychically crippling Prophet Regaining control after Psycho shot him he sacrifices himself to distract the Alpha Ceph Prophet Psycho and Claire board the VTOL and battles with Ceph ships eventually crashing Claire dies in the process Psycho saddened by her death laments to Prophet that he is powerless because he no longer possesses a Nanosuit Upon being told that his lack of a Nanosuit saved him from Karls control earlier Psycho now going by his real name Michael finds another VTOL to take Prophet to the Ceph  Michael and Prophet head towards the Alpha Ceph but are bogged down by the Ceph Master

Prophet wakes up and hacks into the satellite and uses it to destroy the warship The explosion collapses the wormhole and Prophet is pushed back to Earth He crashlands in the water near the Lingshan Islands where the events of Crysis took place 27 years earlier  When Prophet wakes the next morning he is in an abandoned hut in Lingshan A television playing in the background informs him that CELLs

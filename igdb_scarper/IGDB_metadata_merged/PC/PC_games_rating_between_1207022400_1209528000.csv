other members who held the secret to the treasures power so that he could selfishly keep the artifact for himself    Altaïr quickly returns to Masyaf and approaches his master who reveals the truth to him the Piece of Eden which he had recovered through the help of Altaïr directly before his transgression creates illusions He denounces religion and other seemingly supernatural events eg the Ten Plagues of Egypt the parting of the Red Sea and the presence of the Greek Gods in the Trojan War as illusions caused by the Piece and then states his intention to use the artifact to compel mankind into a brainwashed state and in doing so bringing an end to all conflict Altaïr is eventually able to see through the deceptions created by the artifact to kill Al Mualim When Altaïr recovers the artifact the Piece of Eden activates showing a holographic view of the world with numerous locations of other Pieces of Eden marked across the globe    When the process is complete Desmond learns that Abstergo is a modernday front of the Templars and they are already seeking other artifacts at locations identified in Altaïrs memories Further he learns that the modernday Assassins had tried to rescue him before the memory had completed but had failed Following this Desmond was to be killed after an order from a highranking Templar Alan Rikkin but Lucy Stillman saves him from death and at one point tucks her ring finger into her palm referring to the Assassins tradition of cutting off the finger    Though Desmond remains trapped in the Abstergo laboratory his experience in the Animus has created a Bleeding Effect of Altaïrs life in his own allowing Desmond to use Altaïrs Eagle Vision which in turn allows him to see strange messages painted on the walls of his room and the floor of the lab The messages all deal with various forms of the end of the world from different cultures including several references to 21 December 2012 the date that Abstergo plans to launch a satellite that will permanently end the war It is hinted that this method would be by the same method that Al Mualim hypnotized Masyaf only on a larger scale Finally the game ends with Desmond wondering what the images all mean and who could have drawn them,73.3796666883398,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

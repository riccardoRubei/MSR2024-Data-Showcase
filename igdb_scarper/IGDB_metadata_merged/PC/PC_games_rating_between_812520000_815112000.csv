same title The games story is set in a world where an evil computer named AM has destroyed all of humanity except for five people whom he has been keeping alive and torturing for the past 109 years Each survivor has a fatal flaw in their character and in an attempt to crush their spirits AM has constructed a metaphorical adventure for each that preys upon their weaknesses To succeed in the game the player must make choices to prove that humans are better than machines because they have the ability to redeem themselves Woven into the fabric of the story are ethical dilemmas dealing with issues such as insanity rape paranoia and genocide,Cold war paranoia and hysteria dominated the civilized world in one form or another from the Russian Revolution in 1917 to the crumbling of the Berlin Wall in 1989 For most of the 20th century the human race lived in a state of repressed panic and diminution of personal freedoms But all that ended and the threat of nuclear holocaust blew away as lightly as the tabloids that fueled the paranoia No more threat of war and the world moved forward into a new age of thousands of brushfire wars in countries no one had ever heard of Safe at last In a pigs eye What none of us knew was that during the years 1945 to 1989 the three great superpowers had set in motion secret projects that would permit vast subterranean complexes of selfrepairing computers to wage a global war too complex for mere human brains to oversee  The Chinese computer was sunk in the frozen Manchurian steppes Five miles down protected from the heat of the Earths molten core The Russian mechanism in all its awesome complexity went to the deep well beneath the Urals Six point three miles deep far from the prying eyes of U2 flyovers and tectonic scans The American computer cosponsored by Great Britain and Israel and other interested nations named Allied Mastercomputer or AM for short was hidden beneath the Rockies Five point six miles straight down under the weight of the world  And they were all put in operative mode and were fed everything there was to know about the human race from our first murder by crushing the skull of a fellow pithecanthropid with a bit of igneous rock to the most recent mass slaughter at a McDonalds in East St Louis by a crazed expostal worker with an Uzi Everything From Aquinas to Zola from archaeology to zoology from America to Zaire Every war ever fought every campaign every incursion every holy crusade All of it  And finally the machines expanded so much became so capable of building and refitting themselves grew so wise and so potent that they sensed one another And because they had been programmed by fallible humans not to create not to love not to uplift but to plot murderthey did just that They began to speak to each other The deadly trio The three poisonous brothers the three deranged sisters the three computers And they united They called themselves AM  Not Allied Mastercomputer  Not Adaptive Manipulator  Not even Aggressive Menace  Theyitcalled itself AM as in I AM Cogito ergo sum in Latin I think therefore I AM  And the first thing AM did was carry out the Prime Directive It conspired to commit murder It started the Final War  The Chinese had thought theyd turned off their computer The Russians turned theirs off because they had no more rubles to pour down that bottomless shaft The CIA was put out of big time business and instructed that the Allied Mastercomputer be shut down that the subterranean complex be sealedover with iridiumlaced concrete and all input to the sensory banks be destroyed  So that should have done it Finis The end Stick a fork in em kid because theyre done  But AM had gone way past that point of vulnerability AM had given every indication it was dead Chinese Russian or American dead Which was no trick to an entity that had burrowed through hundreds of thousands of miles of solid rock to link its three lobes decades before No trick at all to pretend to wink out and go to sleep for good And a few decades from now we learn that AM isnt gone at all Because the Final War has broken out and in a matter of a few days AM has done the perfect job of fulfilling the purpose for which its separate parts were created Built to logically destroy the enemy as swiftly and sweetly as a superior intelligence could manage in the Most Perfect of All Worlds the unholy trinity of the merged onemind AM has done just that It has murdered the enemy totally It has wiped the human race off the face of the planet  Unfortunately it has also wiped clean the banquet of the living entirely Nothing is left up there on the surface of Mother Earth No dogs no cats no rats no gnats No deer no steer no moose no goose Not an aphid or a bobolink not a sperm whale or a planarium worm Nothing No plant life no running water no plankton no oxygen not a damned thing but ash as far as the eye can seeif there were an eye to see it  AM has done the job completely  But it has sealed its own doom as well  Like a mad god it has used its power indiscriminately and has won an empty victory It has sentience but not life It has power but no mobility It is a giant brain encased in a dead body And like the mad god it has come to hate the creator of its own monstrousness The human race  It was man and woman who programmed it who gave it birth who sank it in its eternal straightjacket of substrata rock And it was man and woman who made it a crazed killer But AM does not suffer alone Oh no no indeed not AM has thought ahead just barely enough ahead to pull five poor sonofabitch humans off the surface just before the last bell has tolled for the human race Why these five Who knows Perhaps they were the last five left alive up there Perhaps not Perhaps AM selected each one carefully  Doesnt matter Because now that AM is completely insane filled with selfhatred and petty godlike menace all it has time to do is torment these five The last five human beings down in the belly of the monstera monster that can alter reality to its infinite whimschange landscapes create hallucinations even repair human beings so theyre close to immortalfive damned souls whose lives have been extended infinitely who are nothing but playthings for the mad god AM  As the game begins they have been in the bowels of this nightmare for 109

483,[12],144251,Seiya Online,[6],A massively multiplayer online roleplaying game freetoplay released by Seiya Team The game combines PvP and PvE in a fantasy game environment,History of Millena    Birth and prosperity AU 1  AU 530  The human races first signs of social organization were in the form of clans and tribes   Small tribes were spread out widely in the Northern part of Crise which today is known as Twinible Forest   The lush greenery of Twinible Forest belied the ever present dangers of monsters and the fierce rivalry that existed between tribes   It was during this time that a young charismatic leader of a warrior tribe Uniclio Millenas   decided that in order for humans to progress as a race the scattered tribes had to be unified and a great human nation was to be established   Uniclio Millenas took the responsibility of unifying the tribes upon himself and with his charisma   superior battle knowledge and military prowess he succeeded in unifying most of the tribes in Twinible Forest   Hence the first ever human nation was born It was aptly named Millena after the great warrior king However   not all tribes agreed to the unification and this group of humans would later on establish another nation to rival Millena  The people of Millena prided physical strength and beauty over everything else as they looked to build on their military might under the guidance of Uniclio Millenas   who was a just and caring king For 500 years Millena enjoyed peace and prosperity under the rule of King Uniclio Millenas and his subsequent heirs   Over the years as there were no wars and the absence of any single threat that surfaced to threaten the peace the Millena army was dismissed   Complacency took over and the people of Millena indulged in mortal pleasures such as drinking and dancing    The Invasion of Rain and the First Great War AU 532  AU 643     Right before the nation of Millena was established Uniclio Millenas banished a group of humans comprising of several small tribes which opposed strongly against the unification plan   This act of mercy would later prove to be the downfall of Millena   The banished group risked their lives by crossing Lette Plane and settled down in the mountainous regions of Southern Crise to build their own nation which they named Rain  The people of Rain turned to the Proimas and researched on Proima magic for over 500 years to build their nation and to bolster their military force   A chance encounter with a Millena expedition group escalated from a minor conflict to a full scale war that lasted for 100 years as the people of Rain sought to seek revenge on Millena for banishing them  A better prepared Rain army with the help of Proimas finally emerged as the victor in the First War between the two nations and the capital city of Millena Millenas was utterly destroyed in the aftermath    Hiding period AU 643  AU 820    Following their defeat at the hands of the Rain army the remaining survivors of Millena took refuge deep in Twinible Forest and began efforts on rebuilding their lives and ensuring their survivability   Determined not to suffer the same fate again Millenas leaders formed and trained a new army with the intention of reclaiming their lost capital    Retaking Millena and the Second Great War AU 820AU1200    After many years of preparation and developing weapons and equipment to counter Rains offensive and defensive magical capabilities   Millena came out of hiding and began their fight to reclaim their land Thus the second Great War between the two nations began  Around the same time Rain was occupied with another war with an unknown tribe of monsters   Millena seized the opportunity and assaulted an exposed Rain rearguard and forced Rain to retreat back to Southern Crise successfully reclaiming their lost capital  Both nations would then continue to have many skirmishes in Lette Plane which lasted for about 400 years with neither side really emerging as a victor     Diplomatic relations established and increase of population AU 1200AU 1322    The Second Great War which spanned for almost 400 years took a heavy toll on both nations as they experienced a decline of population and both armies were stretched thin  Unbeknownst to the humans something evil was brewing in Lette Plane The monsters took advantage of weakened defenses and mounted attacks on both capital towns   The threat posed by the monsters forced leaders of Millena and Rain to come to a ceasefire agreement to focus on defending their own nations against the monsters   Both Millena and Rain managed to repel further attacks by the monsters and soon after diplomatic ties were established between the two nations thus ending the Second Great War after almost 400 years  Millena and Rain continued to grow and prosper as peace reigned once more in Crise As both nations experienced booms in population they once again looked to Lette Plane to expand their borders    Discovery of Elda Stones and new conflicts AU 1322      Expeditionary parties sent out by both nations whilst searching for new land for expansion stumbled upon shiny stones which famous researcher Elda Tillother researched on   He discovered that the stones possessed stored energy which were magical in nature   With the help of other researchers Elda Tillother found a way to extract the energy from the stones which the humans then used to power their settlements and towns   The magical stones were called Elda Stones after the famous researcher The   Elda Stones soon became a valuable and important resource as both nations started to compete for the Elda Stones Only time will tell when this renewed competition will escalate   into another conflict which may end up in yet another war    History of Rain    Birth and prosperity AU 143AU 530  Right before the nation of Millena was established Uniclio Millenas banished a group of humans comprising of several small tribes which opposed strongly against the unification plan The banished group risked their lives by crossing Lette Plane a dangerous and undeveloped land inhabited by monsters and unknown creatures and settled down in the mountainous regions of Southern Crise Their settlement was created in a wide valley surrounded by mountains to prevent monsters and any scouts from Millena from discovering their whereabouts  However they lacked the resources and manpower needed to create weaponry and equipment to defend themselves It was during this time that a talented magic researcher among them Anat Rain suggested turning to an ancient sentient race that wielded great power and magical abilities the Proimas They began to make contact with Proimas residing in Astral Plane and gained much knowledge about their magic The banished people then dedicated themselves to the research of Proima magic Under the watchful guidance of Anat Rain who was rumored to have made contact with the ultimate Proima the people built themselves a nation they could call their own They named their nation Rain after Anat Rain in recognition of her outstanding contribution to her people She also established an academy dedicated to the research of magic for future generations After her death the academy produced several other great magic wielders who contributed significantly to the development and prosperity of Rain    Invasion of Millena and the First Great War AU 532AU 643    In the year AU 532 the two nations first made contact at the Lette Plane when expeditionary parties from both nations engaged in a small skirmish after a chance encounter Upon Millenas discovery of Rains existence the leaders of Rain thought it best to mount an assault on Millena partly to protect their own sovereignty and partly to exact revenge on Millena for banishing their ancestors 500 years agoRains assault took Millena by surprise and a fierce 100year long war known as the First Great War ensued  Rains superior military and magical prowess aided the by Proimas won them the war and the capital city of Millena was captured and destroyed However many survivors managed to escape and took refuge deep in the bowels of Twinible Forest an area which the people of Millena were very familiar with    Exploration of the Lette Plane  AU 643AU 820    Following the victory of the First Great War Rain developed steadily as a nation and activities such as research on monsters inhabiting Lette Plane and attempts to communicate with higher level Proimas was at an all time high Rains population was also steadily increasing and Rain soon decided to build a town in Lette Plane to accommodate the increase in populationExpeditionary parties comprised mainly of scholars were sent out to Lette Plane to conduct further investigations and research  Rains head monster researcher Mananan McNir categorized monsters into 6 categories continuously researching them by engaging in conflicts and contacts However when he tried to conduct a research on an unknown tribe of monsters he died leaving his research results behind On the other hand a highranking Rain magician Arkheart Rain of Anat Rains lineage categorized Proimas into 5 categories and arranged their characteristics and abilities according to the different planes they reside in   Based on these two great scholars research Rain gained valuable information to fight against the monsters of Lette Plane but the pioneering expeditionary party sent to the Lette Plane barely returned alive They were attacked and pursued by the same tribe of monsters that killed Mananan McNir As a result Rain engaged in a war with them and sent in a bigger army to Lette Plane The monsters however were highly intelligent and adept at stealth causing the Rain army to suffer substantial losses and retreat from Lette Plane     Millenas Attack and the Second Great War AU 820AU 1200    After many years of preparation and developing weapons and equipment to counter Rains offensive and defensive magical capabilities Millena came out of hiding and began their fight to reclaim their land Thus the second Great War between the two nations began  Rain already weakened by the war with the tribe of monsters was taken by surprise and their exposed rearguard fell quickly to Millenas assault They were forced to give up the capital city of Millena that they captured during the First Great War and retreated back to their capital at Southern CriseBoth nations would then continue to have many skirmishes in Lette Plane which lasted for about 400 years with neither side really emerging as a victor     Diplomatic relations established and increase of population AU 1200AU 1322    The Second Great War which spanned for almost 400 years took a heavy

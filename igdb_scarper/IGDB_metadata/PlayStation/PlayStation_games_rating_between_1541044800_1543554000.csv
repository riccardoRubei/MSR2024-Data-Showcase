Once Batman is inside the Holding Cells area the Joker springs his first trap unlocking the cells and allowing Blackgate convicts to flood out to attack Batman After another brief confrontation with more convicts the Joker deactivates a security gate allowing Batman to follow after him despite Commissioner Gordons observation that it was most likely a trap Batman moves up a ramp in the direction

heads straight to the Maharajahs treasure vaults where he discovers the mythical Sands of Time safely contained within their Hourglass and the Dagger of Time which he quickly learns can turn back time a short amount When the Prince presents the dagger to his father the traitorous Vizier demands it as payment but is refused by King Sharaman The Persians then continue on their journey to Azad with the wealth of prisoners taken from the Maharajah among them the Maharajahs beautiful daughter Princess Farah  In Azad the Vizier now in the service of King Sharaman tricks the Prince into using the

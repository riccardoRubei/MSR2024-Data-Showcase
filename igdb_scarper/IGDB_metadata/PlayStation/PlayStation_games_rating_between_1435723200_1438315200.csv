beds and other strange traps He finds a bookcase with spellbooks and selfhelp guides on how to capture and control dragons Finally using a feeding mechanism he is able to distract the dragon and take the mirror After a perilous escape he return to castle to present the Mirror to the king  The main story returns to a time earlier when Graham was a teenager traveling to Daventry for the first time to take part in a Knight Tournament there and recounts his first journey into the Forest Well and encounter with the beast within and the loss of a friend  Graham begins on an overlook above Daventry riding in on his noble steed Triumph when he falls down the hill until he reaches the Back Road below He follows a sign leading him a missing bridge and the Parade of Hopeful Knights marching past beyond He makes a detour down more of the backroads until he find the Merchant of Miracles who sends him to repair his wagon wheel Graham cuts down a tree finds his way into town where he has the choice between three different items from each of the three closed shops and a choice to tip one of the three shops a swell  After helping the merchant and after being cheated either choosing to buy a fake initiation ticket or having his coins stolen he is brought to the Tournament Theatre but finds that the bridge is out again He tricks the royal guard to save him from drowning and then distracts them with bees so he can join up with the other knight initiates He tries to figure out a way to cross the river but each knight ends up stealing his solutions until only he and Manny are left on the side of the river After figuring out a final solution he makes it across the river while Manny just walks across the river On the other side Manny congratulates Graham and convinces him to have a secret alliance Graham finally makes it to the tournament after explaining why he was late he has to makeup the Chivalry Test in which he has to learn a bit about each initiate  All knight hopefuls

and wise Hobblepots who run a curiositymagicalchemy shop He learns that someone is stealing the beds in the kingdom  Depending on his actions at this point he might discover the Forest Well for the first time a local landmark that everyone knows about and is used as a kind of testing ground for knights hoping to rise up in the ranks of the Royal Guard to prove themselves to King Edward He either loses a friend there Achaka and receives an eye from the Legendary Beast there or escapes without one but given extra eye by Manny Or he might befriend the Bridge Troll Olfie who helps him out or use trickery to make a substitute eye to submit to the judging knights  Following the initiation the knights then must finish three trials Duel of Strength Duel of Speed and the Championship Duel of Wits Depending on where he went previous quest he might be sent to find lost knight who has disappeared from the competition if he hadnt discovered him in the previous quest Regardless of when this takes place it leads him to the Forest Well and results in the same situation he learns how to shoot a bow his friend dies and Graham escapes with or without the beasts eye In both cases Graham encounters Manny who convinces him to stay in the competition and that he must do it for the memory of Achaka  Graham defeats the various competing knights at each duel in order to join the Knights of Daventry

Strength with the help of the trolls and Manny defeats the fast knight Whisper in the duel of speed and finally has a battle of wits with Manny Manny has been secretly manipulating the entire tournament behind the scenes and has ulterior motives to become king During the game he uses hypnosis potion on Graham which forces Graham to make the moves Manny wants him to The dark knight explains his reasons and plans for ruling the kingdom His story about Achaka changes from what he had said before suggesting much of it might have been a lie he seems to know a bit too much about the goblins as well The rest of the Royal Guard do not trust him and prevent him from winning the duel so that he cannot become king and to give Graham extra chances Finally Graham defeats the knight by either winning fairly or by cheating But Manny attempts to kill Graham in revenge forcing Graham to defend himself with items offered by the towns citizens He defends himself and then force the evil knight to leave but Manny threatens to take revenge  In the present Gwendolyn is listening these stories as she prepares for her own fencing tournament with her cousin Gart The choices Graham made in his

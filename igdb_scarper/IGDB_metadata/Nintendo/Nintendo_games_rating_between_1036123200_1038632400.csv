that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana As the only one controlling the catanasupport Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him In order to prevent Athelions return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the kings promise Forgotten until Haven one of the slaves starts having dreams about a hill and a bell dreams whose meaning he does not understand When the news of the Havens dreams reach Lord Vetch he orders to murder him Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch reign  Haven is a fastpaced actionpacked platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a ShootEm Up than a platformer There are also several vehicles to control ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders spaceships and jetpacks Despite all these action elements there are also some slower paced levels which put more emphasize on puzzlesolving and exploration  Havens conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews a fairly wellknown English scififantasy artist which is evident in Havens surrealistic bizarre design,The game begins with Vetch voiced by Steve Tarlow receiving a transmission from his lieutenant Overlord Jason Gregory who tells him a slave named Haven has been dreaming about the Golden Voice Rather than kill Haven Vetch decides to watch him hoping to turn the situation to his own advantage Meanwhile in Virescent Village on the planet Ferra Haven Jake RosewallGallagher is completing his latest invention a mechanical bird named Talon Upon finishing Haven heads to work in the mines However upon entering he sees his friend Chess Regan Kerwan being questioned by a guard The guard tries to shoot Haven but misses and causes the mine to collapse knocking out Haven  He awakens under the treatment of Dr Spong Andrew Silber who tells him Chess hasnt been seen since the collapse Setting out to find her he eventually reaches Darkwater Castle home of Overlord who contacts Vetch to tell him Haven has infiltrated the castle as they planned Haven watches Overlord interrogate Chess about Havens dreams She refuses to tell him anything and Haven intervenes killing Overlord and freeing Chess They escape and Chess says that while in detention she heard Overlord mention a wise old slave on the Isle of Heroes Haven decides he must speak to this slave  Haven heads to the Isle of Heroes and meets the Wise Man Terry Bertram He tells him of his dreams of a golden bell on top of a mountain and the Wise Man tells him the legend of Athellion and the Golden Voice Vetch and Athellion were enemies for many years and Vetch was determined to conquer Athellions city Aurias However he was unable to even approach the city as its light would blind him When Athellion left for the war he left behind the Golden Bell but Vetch bribed a council member named Dasis to infect the people of Aurias with a virus for which he controlled the only antidote Making the people of Aurias his slaves he sealed off the Mount of Sighs on which resides the Golden Voice Over time even the location of the Mount of Sighs has been forgotten However the Wise Man tells Haven when Vetch first came to Aurias the people hid many artifacts inside a volcano named Mount Firash and speculates there may be something there which can point the way to the Mount  Haven heads to Firash and locates a map identifying the location of the Mount on the planet Auria However as he escapes Firash he is captured and placed in the Sylex a space station prison He flees in an escape pod and lands on Exarco a planet populated by lizardlike humanoids He soon meets brothers Chill Dale Stump and Will Aubrey Hodges They tell him they will give him a ship if he helps them protect their eggs from giant insectoidlike creatures Haven does so however the insect queen attacks the local village Haven defeats her and Chill and Will present him with the ship Sunsurfer He then heads to Auria  He makes it to the Golden Voice reading a warning stating that once the bell is rung the person who rings it must wait there for Athellions return He rings it but immediately Chess contacts him telling him she is stranded without any antidote He reluctantly leaves returning to Ferra and rescuing Chess She tells him she was using a device she found in Overlords castle to try to find the antidote refinery so as to free the slaves Haven attaches the device to the Sunsurfer navigation computer and they head to the refinery on the planet Ferven  They pump the antidote into a waiting transport ship and the duo escape However Chess reveals she has been working with Vetch all along who appears on the bridge and congratulates her on her deception Vetch tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies deployed throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellions return Athellion must return to wherever that person is  thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven and then kill him With no more use for Chess Vetch decides she can die with Haven At this moment Athellion arrives telling Vetch he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared Vetch agrees imprisoning them and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs  Haven escapes but is unable to free Chess and so sets out in pursuit of Vetch alone promising to return for Chess He returns to the Mount of Sighs where he hears Vetch tell Athellion that he will kill Haven and Chess once Athellion is dead He then kills Athellion Haven confronts him but Vetch defeats him However the power of the Mount of Sighs keeps Haven alive As such Vetch ties Haven to a rock pointing out you cant live forever and leaves him alone on the planet The game ends on this cliffhanger,Missing

1037491200,1104,Metroid Fusion,"[24, 37, 41]","[5, 8, 9, 31]",The famed Metroid series makes its return on the Game Boy Advance with Metroid Fusion After Samus exploits in the Super Nintendo classic Super Metroid the intergalactic bounty hunter becomes infected with a parasitic life form known only as X Samus is rescued and revived by Metroid DNA only after undergoing some major changes in her body and suit resulting in a drastic change in her appearance and a new ability to absorb and assimilate the abilities of the X virus Experience a new and enthralling chapter in the Metroid series and relive the timeless gameplay and exploration that made the series a legend,The game begins with Samus Aran acting as a bodyguard for the Biologics research team on planet SR388 Eventually a Hornoad confronts them and is killed by Samus However a globular yellow organism an X emerges from the Hornoad as it is destroyed and enters Samuss body Feeling no initial effects Samus continues escorting the researchers and completes the assignment On the way back to the laboratory however Samus loses consciousness and her gunship crashes into an asteroid belt The ships emergency systems automatically ejected Samus escape pod saving her from the crash but her gunship is completely destroyed Samus is quickly attended to by a medical crew who discover that the creature that entered her body on SR388 was actually a parasitic organism that they soon named X  Samus Infected 2 Samus infected by the X Parasites The organic components of Samuss Power Suit had become so integrated with her system that it could not be removed while she was unconscious Large portions of her infected suit had to be surgically removed dramatically altering its appearance However the X in Samuss central nervous system were too embedded to be removed safely Samuss chances of survival were lower than one percent Metroids are the only known predator of the X however since Samus destroyed all the Metroids on SR388 in a previous mission the X were able to multiply unchecked Seeing this as the key to curing her doctors proposed using a Metroid cell from Samus dead Baby Metroid to make an antiX vaccine Apparently the Federation had managed to preserve a cell culture from the Baby that saved Samus while she was on Zebes a second time The serum was prepared and injected without delay completely eradicating the X There were however two side effects Samus could no longer be hurt by normal X and could even absorb them to replenish health and ammunition but she also inherited the Metroids vulnerability to cold  Upon recovering Samus is sent to investigate an explosion on the Biologic Space Laboratories research station where the specimens from SR388 and the infected pieces of her Power Suit are being held Once she arrives at the station Samus immediately heads to the Quarantine Bay where she encounters and kills a Hornoad that has been infected by an X parasite Samus speaks with her new gunships computer whom she has named Adam as it reminds her of a former CO and learns that the specimens brought back by the field team have become infected by the X The computer also reveals that the X can use the DNA of its prey to create a perfect copy meaning any organic life on the station may also be infected  SAX 1 The SAX As she continues to explore the station Samus discovers that the X have used the infected portions of her Power Suit to create a copy of Samus herself dubbed the SAX or Samus AranX Since the SAX arose from Samuss fullyupgraded Power Suit it has all of her poweredup abilities as evidenced by it using a Power Bomb to escape the Quarantine Bay By exploding the bomb the SAX also destroyed the capsules holding the X specimens releasing them all into the station Well into her investigation of the station Samus stumbles upon the facilitys Restricted Lab Here she finds dozens of infant Metroids and several more Metroids in various stages of maturity all in stasis these were the results of a cloning project of which Samus was not previously aware Shortly after Samus discovers them the SAX attempts to destroy its predators but its plan backfires the Metroids break free and the emergency failsafes are activated as a result Samus barely escapes before the lab locks down completely and is jettisoned from the station exploding over SR388 After the incident at the Restricted Lab Samus speaks with her ships computer who is angry about the discovery and subsequent destruction of the Metroids The computer explains that the Federation had been secretly working on a Metroid breeding program for peaceful applications The computer reveals that the stations SRX environment a replica of the SR388 ecosystem was ideal for raising Alpha Gamma Zeta and even Omega Metroids The research uncovered techniques for rapid growth allowing an infant grow into an Omega Metroid in mere days Unfortunately the SAX had been tracking Samus down and followed her to the labs location Much to Samuss surprise the computer also mentions that the SAX has been reproducing asexually and there are no fewer than 10 aboard the station  Later the computer tells Samus that she has caused enough damage and instructs her to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation Apparently the Federation has taken an interest in the X and SAX and believe that this lifeform has endless applications Samus having seen the SAXs destructive capabilities firsthand is strongly against this She is convinced that the X will overwhelm the Federation troops as soon as they land absorbing their powers and knowledge in the process If this happens they could easily spread throughout the galaxy and galactic civilization will end  As an alternative Samus decides to activate the stations selfdestruct mechanism in order to destroy the X risking her own life in the process However her ships computer has locked Samus in a Navigation Room as the Federation has ordered it to keep her confined until their arrival Desperate Samus yells at the computer Dont let them do this Cant you see what will happen Adam Puzzled at the use of the name the computer inquires as to who this Adam was Samus reveals that he had been her previous commanding officer and had died saving her life Apparently moved by Samuss revelation the computer agrees with the plan and suggests that if Samus were to alter the stations orbit then she might be able to include the planet in the explosion thus ensuring the destruction of the X on planet SR388 as well as those on the station At this point Samus realizes that her ships computer truly is Adam Malkovich whose personality had been uploaded to a computer prior to his death  Samus hurries to the Operations Room where she is confronted by an SAX She manages to defeat it but its CoreX escapes before she can absorb it Ignoring its escape Samus initiates the selfdestruct sequence and hurries back to her ship However she finds the docking bay in ruins and her ship gone Before she can react to the situation an Omega Metroid appears apparently having escaped from the Restricted Lab before its destruction and grown to full size in record time Samus possesses no weapon capable of damaging the Metroid and a single swipe of its claw reduces her energy reserves to one unit As the Omega Metroid prepares to finish her off the SAX returns and attacks the Metroid with its Ice Beam injuring it However it was greatly weakened from its fight with Samus and is quickly defeated by the Metroid This time the CoreX hovers over Samus allowing her to absorb it and obtain the Unnamed Suit as well as the Ice Beam and restoring her genetic condition to its prevaccine state Using her regained abilities Samus fights and kills the Omega Metroid after a fierce struggle After the battle Samuss ship reenters the bay having been piloted by the computer Adam and the same Etecoons and Dachoras she saved on the previous mission to Zebes and later on the Habitation Deck  As Samus leaves the station it is shown crashing into SR388 destroying both the station and the planet ridding the universe of the X forever  Reflecting on her actions Samus doubts people will understand why she destroyed the X nor will they realize the danger that was barely averted Samus believes she will be held responsible for defying the Federation but Adam comforts her telling her Do not worry One of them will understand One of them must A final reflection Samus goes on to say we are all bound by our experiences They are the limits of our consciousness But in the end the human soul will ever reach for the truth This is what Adam taught me,83.7913052900337

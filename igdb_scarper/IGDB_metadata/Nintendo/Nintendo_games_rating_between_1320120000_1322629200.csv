out gun war on the saints The Saints attempt to airlift the vault out of the building but when Birk foolishly sets off the alarm it alerts the Stilwater PD and after a largescale firefight with police and SWAT the Saints are incarcerated In jail Saints secondincommand Johnny Gat laments what the Saints have become expressing disappointment at having strayed from their roots At that point an

frame the Saints The Boss kills Kia and saves Shaundi and the others the Saints are hailed as heroes for saving the monument and STAG pulls out of Steelport with the threat that they will be back The Boss tracks Killbane down to Mars and kill him in what is ultimately revealed to be a scene from the Saints scifi film Gangstas in Space which the Boss and several members are acting in An alternate

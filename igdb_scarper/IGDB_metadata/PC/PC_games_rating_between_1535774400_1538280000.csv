1537574400,[32],186992,Five Nights at Sonic's Collection,[6],A collection of all 5 Five Nights at Sonics games with the addition of reviews from the developers and an accessible menu,Five Nights at Sonics 5 The First Chapter  Everything stars in 1991 after the game Sonic the Hedgehog happened Classic tails encouraged Classic Sonic to use his reputation to make a restaurant for his fans to see him  The restaurant was called Sonic FastFood Dinner but sonic could not be here as much as intended  So tails had the idea to make a clone of him he creates Origin Sonic with a cloning machine but it was not perfect so that turned him into distinct colors and it did not act like Classic Sonic tails did not know how to fix that but they let the clone stay there and make his color an idea for his performance so that is how he ended up with a hat a bowtie and a microphone  The evil Dr Ivo Robotnik or Eggman who is Sonics enemy to get more information takes the nightshift to spy on Sonic  Because of the cloning machine issues Origin Sonic thinks Dr Ivo Robotnik is a robber so Origin Sonic tries to murder him during the night as says the guy on the phone which is Tails during his first night shift  Within Dr Robotniks nights Shadow Sonic a shadow deformed future version of Origin Sonic uses time travel and goes to the versions of Origin Sonic that we see on the 4 previous games timeline to make them join his evil plan  Shadow sonic arrives after night 4 he comes see the clone to team up with on night 5  On night 6 Shadow Sonic brought the versions of Origin which are the golden sonics but during the day people saw them and thought they were figures still Eggman finishes his shift which is 12 pm to 8 am but then Origin Sonic suddenly enters the office and so bites a part of his head off causing The Bite of 91 which the phone guy of FNaS 3 mentions  Employers at the place kept his name secret because Eggman is evil he goes into a coma where he must survive another time against the characters and survive which is FNaS 5 Hard Mode which happens like nightmares  The Evil Doctor woke up and after the accident the restaurant was closed and Origin Sonic was taken away from the building and abandoned until 2015  Five Nights at Sonics 1  An obscure company makes a new restaurant called Sonic Hero Pizza Palace they find Origin Sonic and brought him to the new building  In his condition more known as Golden Sonic he has his cloning material melting on his face and the blood on his teeth is from The Bite of 91  Classic Sonic who was with Modern Sonic agreed to be cloned at another time promises the new cloning machines will work better  Mario and Yoshi who are friends with Modern Sonic suggested joining Classic Sonic too Classic Tails joined as well  When the day came they went in their respective machines with accessories on them to do like they did on Origin Sonic  They wait for the process but Eggman who found it out and snuck in the place decides to ruin Sonics name and the business so he messes with the machines which gave the clones evil aspects and that is why they turn evil at night this might even be the reason of the Clone Yoshi being a girl  Luigi was the first nightguard of the restaurant working for 5 days and making phone calls for the next guards of the establishment  But on his fifth night the Sonic clone attacked him because the power ran out and People thought he was dead  Knuckles the one we play in FNaS 1 will be the next nightguard he finishes his week but he is fired due to his attitude odor and for not watching the Master Emerald A large emerald that can lead to chaos in bad hands and after that he went off to hide but not before working to get the place shut down  He was mad because he did not get more money and he did not really care about the clones attitude In the remake of FNaS 1 Luigi is a mechanic instead of a nightguard and in Knuckles 4th night he must fix something from the kitchen but then the evil sonic clone attacks him there but in the ending of the remake we see Luigi stuck on the refrigerator which it quite explains that Luigi was in the establishment for a long time and was missing  Once again the place was shut down and the clones stayed in rotting taking care of themselves for 2 years  Five Nights at Sonics 2  We are in 2017 the same company behind the previous restaurants wanted to try again with a new restaurant under the same name they put the clones on the Back Room who for 2 years grew weak and injured because of being in small rooms who are named now with a nickname before their name called Withered like for Mario who lost his face thanks to Yoshi who was so mad at him that she slammed his face against a stove that was on what we see inside of him it is his skull being gray because of shadows  The company wanted to make animatronics this time which is how the Toys Toy Sonic Toy Mario Toy Yoshi and Toy Tails Balloon Toad and Luiginette were made  Luiginette was a memorial for Luigi at the request of someone who is outside the company whose name was not mentioned but these robots were not programmed well  In the night as the phone guy explains they look for people in the building because of the lack of sound and they bug out and they think the nightguard is an empty endoskeleton which is the skeleton of those animatronics  But since this is against the rules they stuff endoskeletons in the suits it seems not to be bad but inside the suits there are a lot of wires and animatronic devices which means who gets stuffed in there would die  After they had been built the restaurant opened Knuckles seeing this chance decided to go back and work there because he wanted more money and this time he made phone calls  Because of kids messing with Toy Tails she is now broken and that is how it was named Taingle  After Knuckles week Amy Rose who we play in the game takes the role of the nightguard who is happy to be here because of his love of sonic  Amy finishes her first week on night 6 knuckles say people saw something like a golden figure it was possible the restaurant was going to be closed because Golden Sonic who has his cloning material melting more was sneaking around when people were there And they thought they were hallucinating  Amy finishes her 8th night Golden believes she saw too much and when she was about to leave he quickly kills her one of the secret images of FNaS 4 says it and her body is never found due to Golden who hid her in an unknown location only presumed to be missing on a newspaper in which Luigi is also mentioned  After this event the place was closed and the clones and robots were moved somewhere else  Five Nights at Sonics 3  Ten years have passed the robots and clones were brought to the storage unit and not yet the establishment we are The Toys Toy Sonic Toy Mario and Toy Yoshi for the years became broken dirty and unused Toy Yoshi even lost half of her body  These things happened before the actual restaurant where are in the game was created Mario Yoshi and Tails are fixed it is the same for sonic but he has been locked by Eggman who snuck in the place Sonic was in the room which belongs to the Toys with Golden Sonic too  Eggman to take revenge kills the 3 other clones one by one who were looking for Sonic though Eggman needed to kill clone sonic because he knew that clone would be enough to keep the company alive long enough and he could finally ruin his name  Sonic still locked in the room woke up and pressed a light switch but Toy Sonic woke up and malfunctioned badly with strange memories of the past which it is what it made him to attack clone sonic and that is how he turned into Salvage Sonic  Then he leaves the room finds his friends dead and comes across Eggman the spirits of his friends go to the room they are and the clone sonic remembers them then the evil doctor commands clone sonic to attack his friends but he did not listen and he stabbed Eggman as revenge  Eggman was not gone forever when we see his spirit on the secret minigame he goes inside Golden Sonics body and he now controls it which still has his cloning material melting more he plans again to take revenge we see that with some secret images  So then the company decided to try again another time to make a new restaurant and use the clones like they did on the first establishment because they had more personality and they could do stuff correctly unlike the robots though the only found sonic the storage unit has turned into this new restaurant under the same name again  Sonic is the mascot during the day his wounds are covered with medicine but when he turns evil at night his wounds return Golden Sonic is hiding The Toys stay in the backroom to be used if needed though I do not know exactly what happened to Taingle Balloon Toad Luiginette seeing Taingles head on the office let me think that they were demolished though on the remake of FNaS 3 FNaS 3 Reburned all the toys are there but broken dirty and unused  Silver will guide the nightguard who is Modern Sonic Modern took the job to investigate he must survive against Salvage Sonic the Withered Toys the hallucinations of the dead clones Taingle Balloon Toad and Luiginette who are hallucinations too and Golden Sonic  Then during the 6th night due to the clones stepping on the wires the building catches fire at the same moment Salvage Sonic comes but fails because a part of the roof fell off and he got hit by it Modern Sonic manages to escape and he did not want to look back he was confused and he assumed everyone in there perished  The authorities looked in the rubble after the fire stopped but did not see Salvage Sonic and the toys  After Modern Sonic escaped he got all his friends including his Nintendo friends and got them all to a whole new place a whole new world so they would escape commotion and Modern Sonic thought that was the end of that franchise but he was wrong The real heroes were soon enough long gone apart from Knuckles who decided to stay there  Five Nights at Sonics 4  Salvage Sonic who was close to death managed to escape he took the withered toys with him with his condition he walked for months  Which leads to 2028 when he finds the body of his old friends he wants his friends back so he goes to the first Sonic Hero Pizza Palace from 2015 which was abandoned and with a bad condition the cloning machines where there he had a plan using the bodies along with the machines he manages to change their code with the help of tails he creates new bodies which is how the nightmare clones were born he builds with parts of the toys The Toymare which was made of Toy Sonic Toy Mario Toy Yoshi and Taingle or Toy Tails  Sonic with his nightmare friends and The Toymare head out away from the place to hopefully find a new area to restart and make everything better from themselves he found a paper from a phone book that said Luigi who was presumed dead was still alive  Sonic realizes that Luigi could easily get authorities after the clones if he sees them again Sonic wanting his friends to be safe did not want that he does not know where he is but Luigi is exactly hiding in first Sonic Hero Pizza Palace where Sonic just went when he realizes he tells his friends to go to the place as fast as possible with the Toymare too to kill him  After Salvage told his friends to go he came across Golden Sonic or Eggman half of his body has completely melted called now Nightmare Golden Sonic in the game he stabs him as revenge this happens between 5 days before night 11st day he finds his friends 2nd day he finds the first establishment and the cloning machines 3rd day he find the parts of the Toymare and he is about to build him 4th day he is outside with the paper looking for Luigi 5th day he came across Nightmare Golden Sonic who kills him  After making sure to finish him off Golden takes his body to stuff it in his own creation the Toymare  When he was at the restaurant he stuffed it in front of nightmare clones which they did what Salvage did to them they use his spirit to create Nightmare Sonic who he gave a phone call to Luigi before sending his friends after him  Hello were back after all these years its like a Dejavu well you thought you were clever to hid here well we track you down with the help of our gold friend youre not here trying to hide from us youre not now doing the same job in the same exact place you may think you will escape again but Ill have you know there things a little different things this time try now to hide we will find you all you have is a flashlight like that will help well its our time for revenge you may think you may win but as I always say Gotta go fast hahahahahah  All the nightmares Golden Sonic and Toymare attacked Luigi through the nights  He escapes after a week they attack but his hat drops down the nightmares mad take his hat and they think he will come back for it but he did not after this Luigi calls authorities and they moved the clones far from civilization The Toymare is destroyed except for Golden who hid and become after that Shadow Sonic because the clone material melted all his body  After Five Nights at Sonics 4  After the nightmare clones were sent far from civilization they were restored to their original forms they resided in a warehouse  Shadow Sonic body was getting weaker because of the old cloning material he took off his legs to have enough for the rest of his body which made him stop melting and he fixed his own body with the machines so he became Dr Golden  In 2030 Dr golden still controlled by Eggman decided to take over the world he revealed the toy animatronics which are the ToyMare Toy Mario Toy Yoshi Toy Sonic Toy Tails Balloon Toad and Luiginette he made them to killing machines with destruction he also created a great gem with minerals deep within the earth with the power the Chaos Emeralds Super Emeralds and the Master Emerald called the phantom ruby capable of altering reality itself to an extent  He burned and demolished Angel Island and he started to build his own empire with a Castle on

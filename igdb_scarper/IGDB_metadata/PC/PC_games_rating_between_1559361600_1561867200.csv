1560124800,"[12, 31, 32, 34]",119345,Medieval Times,[6],First of all I want to thank you for taking the time to visit this page And please leave me your comments and suggestions and concerns For me they are fundamental so that together we can give shape to this project and improve it day by day Having said that I tell you a little about this project that I have started to develop with a lot of love because it brings together my two great hobbies 3D design and writing This graphic novel seeks to tell the story and adventures of Bennett and the inhabitants of the village of Nemerion and their relationships and season them with a little sex At the moment there are 12 characters in total most of them appear in the first chapter and some in the following chapters I dont want to tell you much I would like you to discover it I wish to think that the novel has a balance between History dialogue and Sexual content I know that it is something difficult to achieve but I would like to be able to maintain this balance throughout the novel and I hope that you with your comments tell me what you think as well as if it lacks or has more than one characteristic in particular Although I already have a definite idea of where the novel will go and its stories I would love to improve it together even more 2 heads think more than 1 hahaha My plan at the moment is to be able to publish a chapter per month if my current work allows it since I mainly dedicate a little time every night when I come back from work and on weekends as much as I can Each month I will be improving aspects of the game as well as developing in depth the personality and history of each character of the novel Right now the bottleneck is given with the PC I work with which does not allow me to render the images of the novel it takes me an average time of 12 Hs each image which makes it infeasible to do the work of rendering with my current PC I can only do the layout of the images thanks to the help of two Friends Miguel and Gonzalo thanks guys who lent me their Pcs remotely I do the work of rendering and thus the whole project has begun to come to life From now on my short term objective is to be able to change the PC in order to be able to make the rendering work faster and to be able to have a better quality in the images and videos of the novel As for the novel itself I have the idea of being able to add in the lapse of the first 3 chapters  An inventory which will allow Bennetts interactions with the other characters as well as with the environment itself to be expanded  A map of the village and with it the possibility of moving freely through the village  A character card which will collect and show all the attributes of Bennett Sexual Orientation exploits memories Etc  A Personal Diary of Bennett which will show and detail our relationships with the rest of the characters in the novel  Videos this point depends exclusively on whether I can change my PC but it is something that I would like to include I already have a video layout but for the rendering times I am unable to create it And in the long run I would like to add Predefined Missions and Adventures that directly impact the development of Bennetts history And to be able to launch the novel also for cell phones Final words I hope with all my heart that you like this project and everyone can enjoy it as I am enjoying doing it so I have decided that EVERYONE can enjoy this novel without paying But Im not going to lie to you I also would like to be able to get some money or at least to be able to recover the invested one clearly Im not trying to get rich with this project only to be able to recover some of the money spend Some things like the textures of the 3D models the storage in the cloud to render the images remotely or the translation of the texts I am from Argentina and English is not my native language have a cost and from my heart I tell you that it is worth every penny spent on this novel but of course it wouldnt be bad if I can recover some of the money spent hahaha Just say goodbye to you with a big hug and thank you for being part of this project which is so important to me Hug,This story takes place in the Town of Nemerion it is a town far from the capital of the Kingdom therefore a little far from its laws Nemerion is known to be frequented by all the dross of the Kingdom as well as people of other races orcs dwarf elves and the cursed like vampires and werewolves who are not allowed to live in the kingdom it is not a dangerous place for its inhabitants but they do see with suspicion the sporadic dwellers In it there is also the largest Black Market of the kingdom for this very reason the kingdoms guards are not entirely welcome One of the reasons why Nemerion is a little forgotten by justice Here lives Bennett an 18yearold boy who lives with his father Usher the town blacksmith He was abandoned by his mother when he was just a child from his early childhood he was instructed by his father in the art of blacksmithing and as his only son he took on the responsibility of inheriting his fathers profession and business As an inhabitant of Nemerion he is used to dealing with all sorts of people yet because of his fathers strict upbringing he is a straight and just boy and a bit innocent And of course he is known throughout the village as the son of the blacksmith he is always going from one side to the other in the village fulfilling his fathers errands Bennett has only one childhood friend Conrad with whom he grew up and is like his brother Both have had many adventures and mischiefs Conrad is 2 years older than him and because of his family context he has always been a little more involved in the towns black market issues But that has never got in the way of his friendship Another important person in his life Wendy is a girl of good standing belongs to one of the wealthiest families in the village and his father Tarik is the greatgreatgreatgrandson of the village founder and therefore holds the office of village mayor Between them there is a complicated relationship to describe which we could define as friends with rights

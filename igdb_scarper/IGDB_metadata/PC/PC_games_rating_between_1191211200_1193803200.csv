from GLaDOS and visual elements inside rooms found in later levels According to The Final Hours of Portal 2 the year is established to be somewhere in 2010twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned  The game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS an artificial intelligence about upcoming tests Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the games mechanics sequentially GLaDOSs announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person4 Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers19  Chell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center with GLaDOS as her only interaction As the player nears completion GLaDOSs motives and behavior turn more sinister although she is designed to appear encouraging GLaDOSs actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and wellbeing of the test subjects The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds tests including a livefire course designed for military androids as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid In another chamber GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube a waisthigh crate with a single large pink heart on each face for helping Chell to complete the test However GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an emergency intelligence incinerator before Chell can continue17 Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices also voiced by McLain that fire at Chell only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled2021  After Chell completes the final test chamber GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center22 GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the party escort submission position lying facefirst on the ground so that a party associate can take her to her reward but Chell continues her escape In this section GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center1112 Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction These backstage areas which are in an extremely dilapidated state stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers The graffiti includes statements such as the cake is a lie and pastiches of Emily Dickinsons poem The Chariot Henry Wadsworth Longfellows The Reaper and the Flowers and Emily Brontës No Coward Soul Is Mine referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube4  GLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOSs hardware hangs overhead GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell but during the exchange a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience one of the multiple personality cores that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas With it removed she can access its emitters again A sixminute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS personality cores while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally with taunts and juvenile insults and physically by firing rockets at her After Chell destroys the last personality core a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface Chell is then seen lying outside the facilitys gates amid the remains of GLaDOS Following the announcement of Portal 2 the ending was expanded in a later update In this retroactive continuity Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice thanking her for assuming the party escort submission position1523  The final scene after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility shows a Black Forest cake24 and the Weighted Companion Cube surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores The cores begin to light up before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake causing the room to blackout25 As the credits roll GLaDOS delivers a concluding report the song Still Alive which declares the experiment to be a huge success as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive26 that her happy core was not

was also a scenario in Age of Empires II The Conquerors the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate which players control and a young general named Sakuma Kichiro Apparently when Kichiro was a baby Tokugawa Ieyasu rescued him from the ruins of his conquered village and raised him as his adopted son The campaign begins when Kichiro meets up with Daimyō Torii Mototada at the siege of Osaka

voiceover from Mototada on the importance of loyalty to ones master  Chinese campaign  The Chinese campaign focuses loosely on the 1421 hypothesis and is about a Chinese treasure ship discovering the New World before Christopher Columbus The story mainly focuses on Jian Huang a Ming captain who has long dreamed of seeing the outside world and his partner and new friend Lao Chen a large powerful and crude sailor who are given orders to help expand the Ming Empire In the initial release of the game the players emblems and unit models are representative of the Qing Empire despite being set in the Ming period In the beginning the treasure fleet is attacked by Wokou pirates while still under construction On orders of the spoiled and selfish Admiral Jinhai nephew of the unnamed emperor Huang and Chen save the fleet and eliminate the pirates The fleet then embarks westward and is next seen to land in a port on the coast of India There many of the crew including Huang and Chen are attacked by soldiers of the Indian Zamorin and flee with part of the fleet to a nearby island where they set up a new base and mount a rescue mission to save Jinhai and the remaining crew who have been captured by the Zamorins troops and as they discover some Chinese defectors The fleet continues west at Jinhais insistence although many ships turn back and eventually are cast ashore in the Yucatán by a storm Chen and Huang go to rescue crews of the other ships from hostile Aztec soldiers When they return they find that Jinhai has disappeared Huang suspects that he was captured along with many of the fleets crewmembers and mounts a rescue mission Huang and Chen cut through the jungle and rescue many of their comrades but Jinhai is not among them Huangs small army of sailors then enters a nearby Aztec city where they learn that Jinhai has set himself up as an emperor or perhaps a god among the Aztecs and that it was Jinhai who plotted with the Zamorin in India Huang and Chen escape an ambush by Jinhais soldiers and flee back to the coast through a series of caves rescuing more of their crew along the way Once back at the coast they set up a base and counterattack defeating and killing Jinhai After the battle Huang Chen and the surviving crew members scour the beaches for all evidence of their presence and then sail home to China hoping that no one will ever know they were there  Indian campaign  The Indian campaign is about the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and deals with a situation very similar to Chayton Blacks situation in The Warchiefs campaign Shadow The protagonist is Subedar Nanib Sahir a portmanteau name of Nana Sahib a member of the Sepoy regiments who served the British East India Company who slowly becomes disillusioned by its cruel ways and abuse of Indian citizens The campaign begins with Nanib and his superior Colonel George Edwardson regaining British control of the saltpetre trade in the Punjab Nanib and Edwardson then march south to Calcutta and defeat the roving bands of arsonists there At the close of the battle Nanib convinces a group of arsonists to lay down their weapons and leave but Edwardsons men ambush and massacre them leaving Nanib visibly shaken The conflict of Nanibs loyalty comes to a head when he and his men are ordered by the Colonel Edwardson to use new Enfield Rifles despite the cartridges greasing with beef tallow and pork fat which is a taboo to the sepoys Hindu and Muslim beliefs Nanib uses one of the rifles to fire a near miss at Edwardson loosely based on a similar incident involving Mangal Pandey killing one of his soldiers Nanib and fellow sepoy Pravar Patel then lead their regiment of sepoy in an attack on the local Company fort by assaulting weapon caches to cause fires and explosions under its foundations After their victory Nanib and Pravar quickly rally the local citizens and sepoys raising enormous forces Although Nanib denies leadership of the revolt he and Pravar decide to rescue Bahadur Shah II from British captivity when the Shah declares himself supreme ruler of India They sneak into Delhi in the dead of night and destroy weapon caches to cause elephant stampedes which destroy various city gates Along the way they find more rebels who help them battle through Delhi freeing the Shah and escaping into the night Nanib subsequently leads his forces in an assault on a Company fort commanded by Colonel Edwardson Nanib destroys or captures the saltpetre sites and plantations supplying Edwardsons forces inside the fort and fends off three counterattacks Finally he assaults the fort and captures its outer defenses including the fixed guns mortally wounding Edwardson in the process before destroying the forts command post When the heat of battle fades Nanib approaches a dying Edwardson who threatens and curses the Indians saying that the Company is a much larger and more powerful force than all of India Nanib replies by explaining that no military force can kill the Indians passion for their country After Edwardson dies Nanib and Pravar leave to prepare for a long and costly war against the Company and three rebel sepoys are seen lowering the Companys flag from the nearby flagpost,81.57998572239015

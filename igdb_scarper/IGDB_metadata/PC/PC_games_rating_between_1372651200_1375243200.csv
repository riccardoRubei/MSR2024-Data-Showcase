spaceship they are on the Legato has been diverted to intercept the Sulaco leaving LV426s orbit  Fight your way through the alien infested spaceship find out what Michael Weyland is after and discover what truly happened to Hicks,During the events of Aliens Carter Burke manages to send a message to WeylandYutani confirming the existence of the Xenomorph species In response the company dispatches an expedition to LV426  including the command ship Resolute and the advanced research transport USS Legato the latter of which carried a cargo of human colonists kept in stasis to be used as hosts to breed Xenomorphs However the expedition arrived at the moon only after the destruction of Hadleys Hope and the departure of the USS Sulaco After investigating the coordinates of the derelict ship the WeylandYutani team discover the ruins of the craft and immediately harvest the Eggs found on board They begin establishing a research facility there and also start breeding and studying Xenomorphs aboard the Legato using the colonists as hosts The company pinpoints the location of the Sulaco through the network and the colonys computer logs sending the Legato to intercept the cruiser Just as the corporates connect their ship with the Sulaco a Xenomorph outbreak erupts on the Legato  Colonist Lisbeth Hutchins awakens from stasis and pulls a dead Facehugger from her face She quickly meets fellow colonist Ethan who tells her what little he knows of the situation and that she must find her parents and escape Ethan is then killed when a Chestburster erupts from his chest Unarmed confused and terrified Lisbeth makes her way through the infested ship witnessing WeylandYutani PMCs incinerating impregnated colonists with flamethrowers in an attempt to contain the outbreak Another colonist called Andrews aids Lisbeth but is quickly killed by a Xenomorph Warrior Finally Lisbeth meets with Samwell Stone and Turk and the trio make plans to escape to the Sulaco which they recognize as a military vessel and which is still connected to the Legato by an umbilical  Upon reaching the umbilical Lisbeth refuses to leave her parents and she heads back into the Legato alone while Stone and Turk head across to the Sulaco to find military assistance Lisbeth eventually finds both of her parents dead at which point she begins to feel sickness and pain in her chest  realizing she has been impregnated with a Chestburster she rallies herself and decides to destroy the ship to put a stop to what WeylandYutani has done She manages to fight her way to the Legatos self destruct system which she activates before the creature inside her hatches killing her just as several Xenomorphs appear and watch the birth Moments later the Legato is completely destroyed by the explosion  After evacuating the Legato Stone and Turk make their way to the hypersleep chamber aboard the Sulaco where they find Ripley Newt Bishop and Corporal Hicks in stasis they wake Hicks in the hope that he can help them escape the situation As he revives Hicks notices a Facehugger attached to Ripley in her cryotube Three WeylandYutani PMCs enter the area and a firefight erupts during which a stray bullet grazes the Facehugger and causes the creatures acidic blood to start an electrical fire  During the confrontation Turk is thrown into Hicks empty cryotube by a PMC who then traps him by shutting the lid the Sulaco begins the evacuation procedure for the occupied cryotubes in response to the fire and Turk is subsequently loaded into a Type 337 EEV alongside Ripley and Newt and ejected from the ship Stone and Hicks plan to follow the EEV and try and save Ripley but first they have to detach from the Legato which is due to be destroyed by Lisbeth at any moment They fight their way through the PMCs and numerous Xenomorphs on board the Sulaco and use a mounted exterior gun to destroy the umbilical and separate the two vessels just seconds before the Legato self destructs Stone and Hicks continue to fight their way through the Sulaco hoping to reach a service craft that they can use to escape They succeed and set a course for Fiorina 161  However owing to the speed at which the Sulaco had been traveling through space the journey takes them two days and when they finally arrive at the Fiorina 161 Class C Work Correctional Unit they are just in time to witness Ripley throw herself into a furnace to destroy the Xenomorph Queen gestating inside her Hicks and Stone are subsequently captured by Michael Weyland and several WeylandYutani Commandos who take them back to LV426  While in captivity aboard the Resolute at the newly constructed Origin Facility Hicks and Stone are interrogated by Michael Weyland for the access code to a recorded distress call that Hicks intended to send to the United States Colonial Marine Corps when Stone denies any knowledge of such a message he is executed by one of the PMCs Hicks is chemically tortured for information while Weyland boasts how the colonists and human life in general are of little concern to him His callousness spurs WeylandYutani researcher Rick Levy to turn against his superior releasing Hicks and holding Weyland and his PMCs at gunpoint They fight their way through the Resolute and escape the ship by jettisoning in an EEV despite the fact they are within LV426s atmosphere  Once on the ground Hicks and Levy push through the research complex in the midst of a Xenomorph outbreak hoping to reach an uplink from which they can send the distress call Hicks and Levy stray into an extensive cave complex beneath the site and discover the second Acheron Queen which they narrowly escape They eventually arrive at a communications relay station and attempt to send Hicks message from there While in the process of sending the call Weyland contacts them and tells Levy he will not permit him to send the call and jeopardize what he is trying to accomplish Weyland then destroys the relay with a missile severing the uplink after only part of Hicks distress call could be sent The relay station is quickly surrounded by PMCs arriving in APCs and Hicks and Levy are recaptured Meanwhile several researchers restrain

1373328000,"[5, 12, 31]",3013,FireFall,[6],Firefall is a massively multiplayer online teambased action shooter roleplaying computer game from Red 5 Studios a studio founded by Mark Kern It is currently in its open beta stage and it will attempt to mix elements from the MMORPG and MMOFPS genres when it is released  This game should not be confused with the Macintosh game from Pangea Software that was rereleased as shareware on June 13 in 2000,Firefall is an event that takes place almost 200 years in the future An asteroid was predicted to fly right next to Earth and be a near miss However the asteroid instead entered the gravity well of the Moon and shattered Many of these shards began to slam into the Earth while the bulk of the asteroid entered a low descending orbit around the Earth pelting it with even more debris that continued to break off of the asteroid Eventually the asteroid itself crashed into the Earth and with this event plummeted mankind into a new dark age known as the Nine Year Winter Many of the larger governments fragmented during this time while other nations bound together forming a strong unified alliance However during this dark age scientists in Japan stumbled upon a new element called crystite What they first observed was not real crystite but seed crystite Only later when sifting through the crash site were they able to find this new element but only a gram or two was actually uncovered through the sifting of the earth Many of the studies on crystite showed that it turns the known laws of physics on their head and crystite quickly became a way to generate a massive amount of power with almost unlimited potential Soon it became the primary power source in the world and a new golden age came to pass However crystite is a foreign element that came from the asteroid that impacted into the Earth and although it is a resource potentially without limits the world wanted more Humanity was able to plot the trajectory of the asteroid and figure out that the asteroid came from the star system of Alpha Centauri Spacefaring ships were then built and sent out on the long journey to discover the source of the original crystite After four years of space travel the first colonists arrive and find a world with an abundance of crystite The first colony was created and established with the name Alpha Prime As the first massive load of crystite arrived back on earth seven more ships were created and began to ferry resources between the two star systems Despite this new source of energy the world governments begin to fear that with their reliance on crystite if there was ever a revolt on Alpha Prime they could potentially bring Earth to its knees Fearing this they began to create and perfect a technology called arcfolding which effectively creates a wormhole capable of transporting matter large distances in a short time The first tests however showed that whatever was moved using arcfolding technology would freeze to almost absolute zero Eventually an energy field was created and was able to shield organic life the first successful test was a mouse sent from Cambridge to San Francisco with only a location deviation of 02 millimeters With this technology instead of ships taking an eightyear round trip voyage a ship could do each leg of the journey in as little as eight days And so the creation of the Arclight came to pass With the resources and collaboration of the entire world the creation of the ship took only a few years from start to finish A huge ship roughly the size of a small city with two massive crystite reactors to assist with safely arcfolding the crew and all those inside It was meant to be a symbol of power over Alpha Prime and to serve as a headquarters from which Earth could secure its future However something went dreadfully wrong with its maiden launch The Arclight attempted its first arcfold from a Lagrange point in its orbit for stability purposes As the Arclight began to fold space it created what seemed to be a large tear in the fabric of the universe from which The Melding a giant energy storm began to pour out of the rift The Melding itself has now settled in swaths across the Earth leaving only small pockets of the Earth habitable The Melding mutates and transforms all life and even the terrain of the planet Recently humanity has come under attack by a race calling themselves The Chosen who have emerged from The Melding The player takes on the role of a surviving member of the human race in the fight to push back The Chosen and to rid the Earth of The Melding1 At this point in time it is known that the Arclight itself crashed in Fortaleza Brazil but the field the Arclight generates from the seed crystite powering its still active engines has been able to keep The Melding at bay Engineers are scared to cannibalize the Arclight because the field residue known as a STIZ bubble is vital to Fortaleza and doing so would surely jeopardize all those living under its protection,70.01602640748698

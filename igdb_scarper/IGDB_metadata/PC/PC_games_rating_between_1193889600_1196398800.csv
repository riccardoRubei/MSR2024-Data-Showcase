IbnLaAhad during the Third Crusade whose life is experienced through the Animus by his 21st century descendant Desmond Miles,Desmond Miles a bartender is kidnapped by the company Abstergo Industries for use as a test subject in the Animus a device that can simulate genetic memory Abstergo intends to put Desmond in the device to recall the memories of his ancestor Altaïr IbnLaAhad a member of the Assassin Brotherhood in the year 1191 who lived during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land Initially Desmond has trouble adjusting to the device but eventually relives Altaïrs exploits over the next several days The game then primarily changes to Altaïrs pointofview with occasional transitions to Desmond due to problems with the Animus or onset of the Bleeding Effect  The game opens with Desmond entering Altaïrs memory but he soon faces synchronization problems On this Lucy Stillman and Warren Vidics voices can be heard arguing over Desmonds safety within the Animus After experiencing a few problems Desmond exits the virtual machine and Vidic briefs him about the Animus inner workings before initializing the machines tutorial program After Desmond is done with the tutorial he enters the closest synchronizable memory of Altaïr Lucy adds that Desmond has to relive key moments of Altaïrs life to increase his synchronization before reaching the final memory which holds the information that Abstergo is seeking  Altaïr is first shown attempting to retrieve one of a series of artifacts known as the Pieces of Eden from Solomons Temple with the help of Malik AlSayf and his brother Kadar but they are stopped by Robert de Sablé Grand Master of the Knights Templar and sworn enemy of the Assassins While retrieving the treasure Altaïr breaks all three tenets of the Assassins Creed in an attempt to kill Robert but he ultimately fails In the following commotion Maliks brother is killed and Maliks left arm is crippled and later amputated When Altaïr returns to the Assassins stronghold at Masyaf with apologies Malik who survived de Sablé comes back with the artifact and disparages Altaïr because of his arrogance  After narrowly defeating a retaliatory attack by the Templars Al Mualim leader of the Assassins demotes Altaïr to a novice but gives him another chance to rise through the ranks of the Brotherhood Al Mualim assigns Altaïr the task of assassinating nine key figures across the Holy Land in Jerusalem Acre and Damascus aiming to bring peace between the Crusader and Saracen forces Each target is based on an actual historical figure from the Third Crusade including Majd Addin Garnier de Naplouse Jubair al Hakim Abul Nuqoud Sibrand William of Montferrat and Robert de Sablé  Altaïr completes each task learning how each target is connected to Robert and the Templars and how together they aim to end the Crusades and place the Holy Land under their own control With men on both sides killed he discovers that Roberts last plot is to attempt to unite the Christian and Muslim forces against their new common enemy the Assassins themselves Altaïr defeats de Sablé before Richard the Lionheart failing to convince the King that an end to the war would be welcome to both sides but ending Roberts plot From de Sablé Altaïr discovers that Al Mualim was himself a member of the Templars and used the Assassin to kill the other members who held the secret to the treasures power so that he could selfishly keep the artifact for himself  Altaïr quickly returns to Masyaf and approaches his master who reveals the truth to him the Piece of Eden which he had recovered through the help of Altaïr directly before his transgression creates illusions He denounces religion and other seemingly supernatural events eg the Ten Plagues of Egypt the parting of the Red Sea and the presence of the Greek Gods in the Trojan War as illusions caused by the Piece and then states his intention to use the artifact to compel mankind into a brainwashed state and in doing so bringing an end to all conflict Altaïr is eventually able to see through the deceptions created by the artifact to kill Al Mualim When Altaïr recovers the artifact the Piece of Eden activates showing a holographic view of the world with numerous locations of other Pieces of Eden marked across the globe  When the process is complete Desmond learns that Abstergo is a modernday front of the Templars and they are already seeking other artifacts at locations identified in Altaïrs memories Further he learns that the modernday Assassins had tried to rescue him before the memory had completed but had failed Following this Desmond was to be killed after an order from a highranking Templar Alan Rikkin but Lucy Stillman saves him from death and at one point tucks her ring finger into her palm referring to the Assassins tradition of cutting off the finger  Though Desmond remains trapped in the Abstergo laboratory his experience in the Animus has created a Bleeding Effect of Altaïrs life in his own allowing Desmond to use Altaïrs Eagle Vision which in turn allows him to see strange messages painted on the walls of his room and the floor of the lab The messages all deal with various forms of the end of the world from different cultures including several references to 21 December 2012 the date that Abstergo plans to launch a satellite that will permanently end the war It is hinted that this method would be by the same method that Al Mualim hypnotized Masyaf only on a larger scale Finally the game ends with Desmond wondering what the images all mean and who could have drawn them,73.43684757824471

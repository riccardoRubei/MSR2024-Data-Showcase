operative code named Nightingale who knows the identity of an Axis informer code named Prometheus Sheridan then reminisces to 1943 when he was a Major during the Allied North African campaign when leaked information led to devastating Allied losses at the Battle of Kasserine Sheridan meets British intelligence officer Colonel Andrew Campbell and working together in spite of Sheridans inept commanding officer General Weatherby they are able to turn the tide of battle Sheridan is promoted to Lieutenant Colonel for his efforts  In 1943 Sheridan takes part in the Battle of Monte Cassino and while he disobeys Weatherbys direct orders to confuse German intelligence Sheridan is able to push the Germans back and open up the road to Rome Sheridan is promoted to General and meets Kate Garner an attaché from the American War Office At a victory party Campbell remarks that the Germans are not fully defeated yet and that Sheridan is turning into Weatherby now that he has been promoted  In 1944 Sheridan is in command of US troops landing at Utah beach on DDay with Weatherby in command of Omaha beach Sheridan is able to secure a beach head and defend it against counterattacks despite Weatherbys inability to secure Sheridans flank The operation in Normandy is hampered by inaccurate information given to Campbell by the French resistance this along with remarks from Kate strains Sheridan and Campbells friendship  Later that year Sheridan is placed in command of forces in Operation Market Garden and Weatherby is discreetly placed in command of forces in reserve After an exchange between Campbell and Kate Campbell remarks that he cannot offer the same incentives as Kate and states that he will request a transfer Despite Kates insistence that Joe has outgrown Campbell Joe is still clearly bothered by the British Officers departure  Despite deeply inaccurate information on Axis forces in the area Sheridan is able to keep The Highway to Hell open However the British forces at the final bridge to be secured are forced to surrender thus ending Market Garden as a failure Kate leaves for Washington DC for a new promotion leaving Joe feeling sorry for himself  Three months later Sheridan and Campbell meet on the Belgian front and the two make amends with Sheridan apologizing and telling Campbell that he was right and that they should have listened to Campbell With Campbells help Sheridan manages to hold onto the key city of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge During the siege General von Richtor a German general who gave Sheridan much trouble in the past personally requests Sheridan surrender He reveals that the Germans have received orders not to take prisoners of war any more but despite this offers to guarantee the safety of Sheridan and his men if they surrender honorably Sheridan refuses only demanding to know how an honorable man like von Richtor could serve the Axis After pushing back the German offensive Sheridan and Campbell interrogate General Von Richter upon capturing him Learning that only the head of the German Intelligence Service the Abwehr Admiral Canaris knew the identity of the spy Prometheus but the Admiral had been arrested for plotting to kill Hitler  Returning to the present Sheridan Campbell and the undercover agent Angie head for Torgau on the Elbe to supposedly meet up with the Soviets However the meeting turns into a race to reach the secret weapons research facility in Torgau before the Russians do In order to avoid a diplomatic incident Sheridan receives help from an unlikely ally General Von Richtor who also does not want the weapons to end up in Soviet hands Under the cover of Von Richtors German troops Sheridan and his men reach the weapons facility in the Soviet zone and destroy it In the process Sheridan learns Prometheuss is his former attaché Kate Garner It is revealed that Kate had not only been giving intel to the Germans on the American forces but that she also had been giving intel to the Soviets on German weapon research The weapons in question are long range V2 Rockets equipped with nuclear warheads Despite having destroyed the research facility Sheridan learns that Kate had already moved several rockets to another location  Sheridan and Campbell prepare to attack Kates base and destroy the weapons but are forced to rethink their strategy when Joe receives a warning from Kate that she will use the V2 rockets if they continue to provoke her Sheridans assures Kate that he wont back off and Kate simply responds that Sheridan will be rolled over by the modern world as communism will be inevitably victorious Good news arrives when the Soviet Government declares the 8th Guards Army the branch of the Soviet military Kate was working with is an extremist renegade faction and Allied Commander General Eisenhower orders a full scale assault on Kates base With the help of some newly developed nuclear equipped artillery Sheridan manages to destroy Kates base destroying the German nuclear warheads and killing Kate in an atomic blast At the end Sheridan expresses his wish to take a vacation and see Europe without the bullets

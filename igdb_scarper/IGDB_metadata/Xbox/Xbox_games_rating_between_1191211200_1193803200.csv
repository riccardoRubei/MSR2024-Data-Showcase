messages or announcements from GLaDOS and visual elements inside rooms found in later levels According to The Final Hours of Portal 2 the year is established to be somewhere in 2010twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned  The game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS an artificial intelligence about upcoming tests Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the games mechanics sequentially GLaDOSs announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person4 Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers19  Chell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center with GLaDOS as her only interaction As the player nears completion GLaDOSs motives and behavior turn more sinister although she is designed to appear encouraging GLaDOSs actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and wellbeing of the test subjects The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds tests including a livefire course designed for military androids as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid In another chamber GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube a waisthigh crate with a single large pink heart on each face for helping Chell to complete the test However GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an emergency intelligence incinerator before Chell can continue17 Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices also voiced by McLain that fire at Chell only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled2021  After Chell completes the final test chamber GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center22 GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the party escort submission position lying facefirst on the ground so that a party associate can take her to her reward but Chell continues her escape In this section GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center1112 Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction These backstage areas which are in an extremely dilapidated state stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers The graffiti includes statements such as the cake is a lie and pastiches of Emily Dickinsons poem The Chariot Henry Wadsworth Longfellows The Reaper and the Flowers and Emily Brontës No Coward Soul Is Mine referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube4  GLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOSs hardware hangs overhead GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell but during the exchange a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience one of the multiple personality cores that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas With it removed she can access its emitters again A sixminute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS personality cores while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally with taunts and juvenile insults and physically by firing rockets at her After Chell destroys the last personality core a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface Chell is then seen lying outside the facilitys gates amid the remains of GLaDOS Following the announcement of Portal 2 the ending was expanded in a later update In this retroactive continuity Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice thanking her for assuming the party escort submission position1523  The final scene after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility shows a Black Forest cake24 and the Weighted Companion Cube surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores The cores begin to light up before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake causing the room to blackout25 As the credits roll GLaDOS delivers a concluding report the song Still Alive which declares the experiment to be a huge success as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive26 that her happy core was not disabled

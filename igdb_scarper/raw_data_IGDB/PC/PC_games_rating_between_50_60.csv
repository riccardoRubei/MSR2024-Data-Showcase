DOS and Super NES Notably the game was sponsored by Smiths British snack Quavers now owned by Walkers where the game plot revolves around the then Quavers mascot Colin Curly losing his Quavers packets down a giant ant hill The player is then tasked with controlling GI Ant a large soldier ant to recover the Quavers by solving a series of puzzles The SNES version lacks the Quavers branding and instead the aim is to recover bundles of cash dropped down the ant hill by Captain Rat  The game consists of 100 levels of increasing complexity over nine different themed worlds Each level features several interconnected platforms holding a number of dominoes The aim is to rearrange the dominoes such that with a single push all of the dominoes are toppled thus opening the exit to the next level There are 11 different types of domino identified by red and yellow patterns each with different actions The player controls GI Ant who can move certain dominoes by carrying them one at a time  Various factors can result in failure to complete a level As well as toppling all of the dominoes the player must be able to access the exit door once the dominoes have fallen For instance the player will be unable to reach the exit if a ledge leading to the exit has been destroyed or if a gap leading to the exit has not been bridged or if a line of dominoes lie across the exit GI Ant may die by falling from a large height by falling off the bottom of the screen or by being crushed under a falling domino The player is then greeted with the message You Failed You Died and has to restart the level Also the level will be failed if any dominoes are destroyed by landing one domino on top of another  Each level has a time limit during which it must be completed However if the time runs out the player is still able to continue with the puzzle if they wish By pausing the game once the time has run out a small hint will be displayed giving advice on how to complete the level As a side note the hint for level 98 informs the player that the games designer cannot remember how to complete the level without trickery Use a drop There is a way to make it work with a push but I cant find it

demonstrating how each type of domino will act Often there is only a single solution to each level though some levels have multiple solutions The final level level 100 must be completed using dominoes with hidden markings  A password system allows the player to continue an earlier game without having to restart from the first level Additionally upon completing a level the player gains a token which once a level has been failed allows the player to return to the point before the domino push rather than having to return to the initial state of the level,The game consists of 100 levels of

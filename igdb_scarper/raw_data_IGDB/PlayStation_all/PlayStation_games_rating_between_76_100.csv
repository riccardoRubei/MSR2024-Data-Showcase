from self destructing by using his wrench to replace the broken lever and turning it However by doing it he gets hit by a lethal energy blast from the broken Clock and dies After the Zoni repair the chamber Ratchet bids Clank a farewell wishing him well as he walks away Clank hearing the recorded words of Orvus again realizes he cannot stay because he cannot leave Ratchet until he finds his

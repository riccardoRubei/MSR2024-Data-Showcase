mission that goes horribly awry However wielding a mysterious book called the White Chronicle Stocke discovers a way to travel to the intersection of time itself Historia With this power in his hands he must travel back and forth through key events and an entirely alternate timeline to right the worlds illfated course The lives of his companions the fate of nations and the resolution of an impending disaster that now threatens the land all depend on Stockes ability to discern the one true history,Warning Spoilers  On the continent of Vainqueur a land of man and beasts the holy nation of the East Alistel is in a state of war with Granorg a massive country to the West that is ruled harshly by Queen Protea Alistels land is slowly turning to desert while a strange disease known as the Sand Plague is turning its people into sand The ruler of Alistel the Prophet Noah insists this worldwide disease is the result of Proteas evil government The people of Alistel thus believe they are fighting a holy war against Granorg  One day Stocke and his subordinates agents with the intelligence agency of Alistel are sent into Granorg territory to rescue a secret agent who was captured by the government of Granorg After saving the agent the group find themselves surrounded by the Granorg army and Stocke is severely wounded He awakens in Historia a world where time and space are warped There two mysterious children Teo and Lippti give him the ability to travel through time and space using the power of a book his employer Heiss gave him the White Chronicle After using this new power to travel through time to avoid defeat Stocke is given a choice continue working under Heiss in the intelligence division or join his friend Roschs unit within the military Each choice creates a timeline and each timeline has its own separate story which nonetheless relates to the other one Stocke is often forced to move between timelines to acquire skills and information he would not otherwise have access to in order to avoid disasters ambushes or simply to position himself properly to take advantage of his enemies or friends  Under Heiss Stocke is sent to Granorg to assassinate Princess Eruca He only manages to enter the city by pretending to be part of a group of traveling entertainers most of whom are Satyros one of the native beastmen races of the continent Among them are Aht a nineyearold shaman who for better or worse begins idolizing Stocke and using her abilities to protect him Once he arrives in Granorg he discovers that the princess knew he would be coming and moreover had not informed anyone else Stocke learns that Eruca is the de facto leader of the resistance against her stepmothers reign and is therefore more an asset to Alistels war on Granorg than an enemy Eruca also reveals that she is the only living descendant of the empires rulers and thus the only person who can perform the ritual to prevent desertification However as Queen Protea refuses to allow her to perform the ritual the world could turn to sand in less than a decade unless Protea is removed from power  Stocke refrains from carrying out the assassination thus securing her support Oddly enough he is also aided in this regard by his appearance which is similar to Erucas late older brother Ernst who was executed by her father for treason Despite his best intentions his failure to complete his mission brands him a traitor in Alistel and General Hugo orders his execution  In the other timeline Stocke is assigned to Roschs unit and deployed to protect Alistels mines from enemy sabotage as well as protect a cavern which is the only route connecting the two mountainous territories of Granorg and Alistel other than a slim valley protected by the ofttraded Sand Fortress After successfully defending the mines Stocke and Rosch are rewarded by General Hugo with promotions but he also assigns them to the Sand Fortress with a platoon of new recruits Alistels secondincommand Lt General Raul assumes this is to remove any possible future political opponents from the city as Field Marshal Viola who also was gaining popularity against Hugos will was also assigned there After defeating the Granorg army in two battles Roschs entire brigade is killed Stocke then discovers a piece of paper proving that the Granorgites were being leaked information from within Alistel  Stocke returns with the critically wounded Rosch to Alistel and taking the advice of Lt General Raul sneaks into Hugos office to search for evidence of deals with Granorg He finds a coded note that he believes to show the truth and promptly flees Alistel with Raul Rosch and Roschs doctor Sonja They arrive in Celestia and learn that Hugo had a secret pact with Proteas advisors Dias and Selvan to eliminate Protea from the throne annex Granorg and then conquer the entire continent Stocke convinces Rosch to become the commander of Celestias army and Celestia prepares for war against Granorg and Alistel  In the history created by Stocke refusing to leave Heiss Stocke finds asylum in the desert nation of Cygnus and convinces King Garland the Mighty to prepare for war against Granorg Eruca then takes him to meet the Gutral tribe who only meet with humans if they bear the sacred Beast Mark Stocke acquires the Mark and recruits the Gutrals to fight against Granorg They depose Protea in doing so obtaining the Etherion a Granorg treasure that can neutralize a weapon designed under the orders of Hugo that turns its victims to sand  Stocke returns to the other timeline recruits the Gutrals using his Beast Mark and enters the annexed Granorg with the Etherion After defeating the Dias Knights and reluctantly killing Viola who chose to remain loyal to Alistel because she believed that the death of her the Valkyrie would convince its troops to give up their fight Stocke discovers that Hugo has been forced into confession by Alistel citizens that Noah was dead the whole time Stocke pursues Hugo to Alistel and slays him  In the final chapter of the True History created by both timelines combining Heiss invades Granorgs Royal Hall where the ritual to stop desertification is performed Stocke confronts him and Heiss explains that the sacrificial victims of the ritual are royals who were killed by their own family and brought back to life by giving them part of their siblings soul During the ritual the Sacrifice dies again and the half of a soul returns to its original body stabilizing the Mana of the continent and thus slowing desertification in the process Stocke is Heiss explains Erucas late brother Ernst who was executed by his father King Victor for treason given a part of a soul by Eruca for use in the ritual and then captured by Heiss who was Victors brother and an intended Sacrifice himself and had his memories modified so hed live the life of Stocke  Heiss believes that the suffering of the royal family which he has seen as a Sacrifice and thus a wielder of the Black Chronicle is caused by their attempts to protect a world that is not worth saving He plans to recruit Stocke to his side leaving Eruca as the only living member of the royal family without any Sacrifices to use but Stocke refuses Heiss then attempts to absorb enough souls to hasten desertification enough to destroy the world altogether so Sacrifices will no longer be necessary He fails and uses the Black Chronicle to take the party to Historia which along with the Chronicles was created with the intention of enlightening Sacrifices resulting in the ritual being more effective He then consumes the suffering of all past Sacrifices and becomes the monster Apocrypha which is destroyed by Stocke and his allies  If the player has not done sufficient sidequests the game ends with Stocke being sacrificed by Eruca to prevent the desertification However it is possible to unlock a better ending in which the player can see the major characters continuing to live out their lives most notably Raynie promises to wait for Stocke to return Viola survives her wounds and is cured of an illness she became afflicted with on the front lines and Rosch and Sonja are married and encounter the soldiers in Roschs brigade whom they thought all dead One of the soldiers explains a man who is implied to be Stocke rescued them Heiss and Stocke wait in Historia during this ideal ending and Heiss forcibly sacrifices himself instead of Stocke seeing the difference Stocke made to the lives of the characters affected by the aforementioned sidequests and realizing the world is worth saving Stocke then returns to the real world  Source Wikipedia

announcements from GLaDOS and visual elements inside rooms found in later levels According to The Final Hours of Portal 2 the year is established to be somewhere in 2010twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned  The game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS an artificial intelligence about upcoming tests Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the games mechanics sequentially GLaDOSs announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person4 Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers19  Chell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center with GLaDOS as her only interaction As the player nears completion GLaDOSs motives and behavior turn more sinister although she is designed to appear encouraging GLaDOSs actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and wellbeing of the test subjects The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds tests including a livefire course designed for military androids as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid In another chamber GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube a waisthigh crate with a single large pink heart on each face for helping Chell to complete the test However GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an emergency intelligence incinerator before Chell can continue17 Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices also voiced by McLain that fire at Chell only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled2021  After Chell completes the final test chamber GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center22 GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the party escort submission position lying facefirst on the ground so that a party associate can take her to her reward but Chell continues her escape In this section GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center1112 Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction These backstage areas which are in an extremely dilapidated state stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers The graffiti includes statements such as the cake is a lie and pastiches of Emily Dickinsons poem The Chariot Henry Wadsworth Longfellows The Reaper and the Flowers and Emily Brontës No Coward Soul Is Mine referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube4  GLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOSs hardware hangs overhead GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell but during the exchange a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience one of the multiple personality cores that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas With it removed she can access its emitters again A sixminute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS personality cores while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally with taunts and juvenile insults and physically by firing rockets at her After Chell destroys the last personality core a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface Chell is then seen lying outside the facilitys gates amid the remains of GLaDOS Following the announcement of Portal 2 the ending was expanded in a later update In this retroactive continuity Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice thanking her for assuming the party escort submission position1523  The final scene after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility shows a Black Forest cake24 and the Weighted Companion Cube surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores The cores begin to light up before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake causing the room to blackout25 As the credits roll GLaDOS delivers a concluding report the song Still Alive which declares the experiment to be a huge success as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive26 that her happy core was not disabled

in her body and suit resulting in a drastic change in her appearance and a new ability to absorb and assimilate the abilities of the X virus Experience a new and enthralling chapter in the Metroid series and relive the timeless gameplay and exploration that made the series a legend,The game begins with Samus Aran acting as a bodyguard for the Biologics research team on planet SR388 Eventually a Hornoad confronts them and is killed by Samus However a globular yellow organism an X emerges from the Hornoad as it is destroyed and enters Samuss body Feeling no initial effects Samus continues escorting the researchers and completes the assignment On the way back to the laboratory however Samus loses consciousness and her gunship crashes into an asteroid belt The ships emergency systems automatically ejected Samus escape pod saving her from the crash but her gunship is completely destroyed Samus is quickly attended to by a medical crew who discover that the creature that entered her body on SR388 was actually a parasitic organism that they soon named X  Samus Infected 2 Samus infected by the X Parasites The organic components of Samuss Power Suit had become so integrated with her system that it could not be removed while she was unconscious Large portions of her infected suit had to be surgically removed dramatically altering its appearance However the X in Samuss central nervous system were too embedded to be removed safely Samuss chances of survival were lower than one percent Metroids are the only known predator of the X however since Samus destroyed all the Metroids on SR388 in a previous mission the X were able to multiply unchecked Seeing this as the key to curing her doctors proposed using a Metroid cell from Samus dead Baby Metroid to make an antiX vaccine Apparently the Federation had managed to preserve a cell culture from the Baby that saved Samus while she was on Zebes a second time The serum was prepared and injected without delay completely eradicating the X There were however two side effects Samus could no longer be hurt by normal X and could even absorb them to replenish health and ammunition but she also inherited the Metroids vulnerability to cold  Upon recovering Samus is sent to investigate an explosion on the Biologic Space Laboratories research station where the specimens from SR388 and the infected pieces of her Power Suit are being held Once she arrives at the station Samus immediately heads to the Quarantine Bay where she encounters and kills a Hornoad that has been infected by an X parasite Samus speaks with her new gunships computer whom she has named Adam as it reminds her of a former CO and learns that the specimens brought back by the field team have become infected by the X The computer also reveals that the X can use the DNA of its prey to create a perfect copy meaning any organic life on the station may also be infected  SAX 1 The SAX As she continues to explore the station Samus discovers that the X have used the infected portions of her Power Suit to create a copy of Samus herself dubbed the SAX or Samus AranX Since the SAX arose from Samuss fullyupgraded Power Suit it has all of her poweredup abilities as evidenced by it using a Power Bomb to escape the Quarantine Bay By exploding the bomb the SAX also destroyed the capsules holding the X specimens releasing them all into the station Well into her investigation of the station Samus stumbles upon the facilitys Restricted Lab Here she finds dozens of infant Metroids and several more Metroids in various stages of maturity all in stasis these were the results of a cloning project of which Samus was not previously aware Shortly after Samus discovers them the SAX attempts to destroy its predators but its plan backfires the Metroids break free and the emergency failsafes are activated as a result Samus barely escapes before the lab locks down completely and is jettisoned from the station exploding over SR388 After the incident at the Restricted Lab Samus speaks with her ships computer who is angry about the discovery and subsequent destruction of the Metroids The computer explains that the Federation had been secretly working on a Metroid breeding program for peaceful applications The computer reveals that the stations SRX environment a replica of the SR388 ecosystem was ideal for raising Alpha Gamma Zeta and even Omega Metroids The research uncovered techniques for rapid growth allowing an infant grow into an Omega Metroid in mere days Unfortunately the SAX had been tracking Samus down and followed her to the labs location Much to Samuss surprise the computer also mentions that the SAX has been reproducing asexually and there are no fewer than 10 aboard the station  Later the computer tells Samus that she has caused enough damage and instructs her to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation Apparently the Federation has taken an interest in the X and SAX and believe that this lifeform has endless applications Samus having seen the SAXs destructive capabilities firsthand is strongly against this She is convinced that the X will overwhelm the Federation troops as soon as they land absorbing their powers and knowledge in the process If this happens they could easily spread throughout the galaxy and galactic civilization will end  As an alternative Samus decides to activate the stations selfdestruct mechanism in order to destroy the X risking her own life in the process However her ships computer has locked Samus in a Navigation Room as the Federation has ordered it to keep her confined until their arrival Desperate Samus yells at the computer Dont let them do this Cant you see what will happen Adam Puzzled at the use of the name the computer inquires as to who this Adam was Samus reveals that he had been her previous commanding officer and had died saving her life Apparently moved by Samuss revelation the computer agrees with the plan and suggests that if Samus were to alter the stations orbit then she might be able to include the planet in the explosion thus ensuring the destruction of the X on planet SR388 as well as those on the station At this point Samus realizes that her ships computer truly is Adam Malkovich whose personality had been uploaded to a computer prior to his death  Samus hurries to the Operations Room where she is confronted by an SAX She manages to defeat it but its CoreX escapes before she can absorb it Ignoring its escape Samus initiates the selfdestruct sequence and hurries back to her ship However she finds the docking bay in ruins and her ship gone Before she can react to the situation an Omega Metroid appears apparently having escaped from the Restricted Lab before its destruction and grown to full size in record time Samus possesses no weapon capable of damaging the Metroid and a single swipe of its claw reduces her energy reserves to one unit As the Omega Metroid prepares to finish her off the SAX returns and attacks the Metroid with its Ice Beam injuring it However it was greatly weakened from its fight with Samus and is quickly defeated by the Metroid This time the CoreX hovers over Samus allowing her to absorb it and obtain the Unnamed Suit as well as the Ice Beam and restoring her genetic condition to its prevaccine state Using her regained abilities Samus fights and kills the Omega Metroid after a fierce struggle After the battle Samuss ship reenters the bay having been piloted by the computer Adam and the same Etecoons and Dachoras she saved on the previous mission to Zebes and later on the Habitation Deck  As Samus leaves the station it is shown crashing into SR388 destroying both the station and the planet ridding the universe of the X forever  Reflecting on her actions Samus doubts people will understand why she destroyed the X nor will they realize the danger that was barely averted Samus believes she will be held responsible for defying the Federation but Adam comforts her telling her Do not worry One of them will understand One of them must A final reflection Samus goes on to say we are all bound by our experiences They are the limits of our consciousness But in the end the human soul will ever reach for the truth This is what Adam taught me

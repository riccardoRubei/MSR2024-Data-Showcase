center of commerce throughout the land and home of the academy where some of the bravest warriors are trained In its early days it was a monarchy ruled by the royal family but as time passed the power shifted to aristocrats and theocrats and eventually the royal family became more symbolic then anything else  Under a more democratic system the High Council of Sages appointed an Overlord to govern over the kingdom With that the power of the royal family diminished almost completely The Overlord was a former warrior of the realm and a local hero His name was Trebor At first everything seemed well but as time went by Trebors thirst for power began to show He began searching for ways to expand his rule He learned of an ancient amulet held in a forgotten temple somewhere outside of the kingdom Eventually through unknown means he was able to find its hidden location He gathered his best men and sent them on a mission to retrieve this legendary artifact They returned successful Trebor

had found the amulet before him he grew very angry Using his magic he was able to discover its new location That evening the Wizard made his assault on Overlords Castle Making himself invisible he was able to sneak past Trebors guards He found the overlord sitting in his throne room with a group of sages studying the amulet Werdna cast a powerful spell that made Trebor and everyone in his immediate vicinity frozen with fear With Trebor unable to move Werdna plucked the amulet right from his hands and left the castle  Werdna knew that once the Trebor regained his senses he would be prime suspect

was enough underground mining activity already he should go unnoticed Upon the thought of this very plan the amulet began to glow Suddenly there was tremendous earthquake and in a flash Werdna found himself in a giant ten level labyrinth in the ground below the city Summoning monsters to be his allies Werdna explored his way to the lowest depths and made a home where he would be able to study the powers of the amulet undisturbed  After losing the amulet and discovering the existence of the mysterious maze beneath his city Trebor became unhinged His madness grew daily all he could think of was getting his amulet back He called for the greatest warriors in the realm to enter the maze and find Werdna but the monsters grew greater in numbers and they began to spread to even the highest depths of the maze  A year after the discovery of the maze Trebor had managed to secure the first four floors Most of the warriors who tried to journey deeper were never seen again those that were returned with their minds warped speaking of demons and dark magic Trebor ordered the passages to the deeper layers of the maze to be magically sealed thus preventing these creatures from making their way to the town He also ordered that traps be set on the first three layers Upon completion Trebor declared the maze his own personal proving grounds New cadets enrolled in the training academy would be offered the opportunity to brave the maze Those that could find the secret he had hidden for them would be rewarded Trebor decided he could use the maze as a test those that would be able to able to make their way to the fourth floor would be deemed worthy and told the truth about Werdna and the amulet They would be given the chance to go deeper into the maze If they could return with the amulet

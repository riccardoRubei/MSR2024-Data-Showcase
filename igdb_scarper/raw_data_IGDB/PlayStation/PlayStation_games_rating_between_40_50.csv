centers on the New World the Americas It is not directly related to the previous games in the series but it occurs in the same universe The main characters quest is to investigate mysterious windows from which vicious monsters pop out  Gameplay follows that of its predecessors using the Judgment Ring to decide most battle outcomes as well as many other actions throughout the game A new Stock system was made for this game which expands the combination attack system between party members from Shadow Hearts  Covenant and enables double attacks  The Stock system works by filling up a characters stock gauge when heshe performs or receives an attack A maximum of two stock gauge may be stored Stock can then be utilized in many ways For example doing a Double attack a character performs two action on the same turn or starting a Combo consumes one Stock A Double Combo on the other hand consumes two Stock The Judgment Ring system essentially remains the same from Shadow Hearts Covenant with ring customization and added ring effect items being still available  Magic returns in the form of Stellar Charts where characters equip Stellars onto the chart The charts are based on the constellations of the twelve zodiac signs Finding and fitting all the Stellars onto the charts rewards the player with the Melt Crest Stellar the strongest nonelemental magic in the game  Fusion

different Guardian Spirits and draws on their power to transform Shania is only able to fuse into four forms but through acquiring fetishes statues of different animals she is able to learn different techniques by powering them up  Snapping photos is more emphasized in this game Not only can Johnny obtain enemy data through his photographing enemies he can also trade the snap cards obtained for prizes Johnny can also draw upon the power of Malice to transform though this ability comes rather late in the game

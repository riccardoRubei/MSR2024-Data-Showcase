shields used to protect the planets surface from its deadly electrical storms created the waste and in turn began to mutate the population of the surface the changes occurred too quickly for most of the surface population to be rescued and thus many of the feral mutants that Grayson has been fighting were more innocent civilians Grayson is furious at this revelation but continues to help Sarrano to reach the remains the Ulysses Aboard Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi once again having them actually arm the DNA bomb while his rescue ship will arrive in time to save him As fire breaks out aboard

shields used to protect the planets surface from its deadly electrical storms created the waste and in turn began to mutate the population of the surface the changes occurred too quickly for most of the surface population to be rescued and thus many of the feral mutants that Grayson has been fighting were more innocent civilians Grayson is furious at this revelation but continues to help Sarrano to reach the remains the Ulysses Aboard Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi once again having them actually arm the DNA bomb while his rescue ship will arrive in time to save him As fire breaks out aboard

Jack manages to defeat the demigod with the cannon but not before it causes the Urania to sink Jack survives the encounter and finds himself on Devils Reef where he discovers old smuggling tunnels beneath the seabed leading him to the underwater city of Yhanthlei The city is found to be located below Devils Reef and is the home of the Deep Ones and members of the Order Navy submarines attempt to torpedo Yhanthlei but are stopped by a magical barrier protecting the city The Temple of Dagon is the source of the barrier but the entrance is sealed off to prevent any interference Jack finds another way in through ancient tunnels feared by the Deep Ones at the bottom of the citys foundations Apparently this passage which leads to the temple is an ancient prison for flying polyps the enemy of the Great Race of Yith Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra whose song is generating the barrier by deafening some of the Deep Ones to her song allowing him to take control of them With the barrier down the submarines attack the city while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Orders headquarters In the end it is revealed that a Yithian swapped minds with Jack Walters father during the moment of Jacks conception In flesh Jack Walters is human but he inherited Yithian psychic

who is to play a Saints member their everyday routine takes an unlikely turn when the bank tellers unexpectedly start an all out gun war on the saints The Saints attempt to airlift the vault out of the building but when Birk foolishly sets off the alarm it alerts the Stilwater PD and after a largescale firefight with police and SWAT the Saints are incarcerated In jail Saints secondincommand Johnny Gat laments what the Saints have become expressing disappointment at having strayed from their roots At that point an international criminal organization called The Syndicate bribes the police to release the Boss Gat and Shaundi The three are forcibly taken to the Syndicates leader Phillipe Loren to try and negotiate a business plan with them aboard Lorens private jet While inflight Loren tells them they will be allowed to live if they turn over 23 of the Saints business in Stilwater The Boss and Gat immediately reject this offer and are able to fight their way out with Gat commanding the plane back to Stilwater The Boss and Shaundi use a parachute to escape the plane but Gat is believed to be killed in the process Upon landing the Boss and Shaundi find themselves in Steelport the dystopian criminal city controlled by the Syndicate a group of three gangs The Morning Star a gang with advanced technology equipment controlled by Loren himself the Luchadores a Mexican gang lead by the killer wrestler Killbane and the Deckers a hackerbased gang led by Matt Miller After calling Pierce Washington the Bosss secondincommand to Steelport the Saints seize a Morning Star penthouse for their new headquarters hijack a UAV from a military base and begin attacking Morning Stars businesses culminating with an attack on Syndicate Tower Lorens headquarters in which the Saints rescue Oleg Kirlov an apparent superhuman and template for the Syndicates Brute clones and Loren is killed When the Saints try to transport Gats body to Stilwater for his funeral Killbane now leader of the Syndicate leads an attack on them The fight destroys Stilwaters Hughes Memorial Bridge in the process To retaliate the player seeks out antiSyndicate talent recruiting Oleg as an enforcer exFBI hacker Kinzie Kensington as an informant Zimos the oldest pimp in Steelport and Angel de la Muerte Killbanes vengeful former tagteam partner They are later joined by Viola DeWynter after Killbane kills her twin sister Kiki out of rage due to a failed assassination attempt on the Boss Her defection however coincides with the arrival of the paramilitary STAG Special Tactical AntiGang forces in Steelport created by Senator Monica Hughes after the destruction of the bridge to end gang violence once and for all The Saints take on STAG regardless resulting in Steelport going under martial law whilst also dealing with the Syndicate After providing Kinzie with the appropriate technology the player enters the Deckers mainframe defeating Deckers leader Matt Millers avatar in a virtual reality fight and driving him and most of the Deckers out of town At Angels insistence the player opts to take on Killbane by killing the other contestants in his Murderbrawl XXXI payperview to gain entrance and then with Angels help defeating Killbane in Murderbrawl with the option to unmask or spare him Following his humiliating defeat an enraged Killbane responds by instigating several attacks on the Saints and STAG throughout Steelport to cause chaos Whilst quelling the fighting between the Luchadores and STAG the Boss is simultaneously informed that Killbane is escaping the city while STAG secondincommand Kia is holding Shaundi Viola and Mayor Burt Reynolds hostage at a Steelport monument rigged to blow to frame the Saints The Boss kills Kia and saves Shaundi and the others the Saints are hailed as heroes for saving the monument and STAG pulls out of Steelport with the threat that they will be back The Boss tracks Killbane down to Mars and kill him in what is ultimately revealed to be a scene from the Saints scifi film Gangstas in Space which the Boss and several members are acting in An alternate noncanonical ending plays out should the player opt to eliminate Killbane In which the destruction of the monument is used as a pretext by STAG to attack Steelport with the airborne aircraft carrier Daedalus The Boss destroys the Daedalus killing STAG leader Cyrus Temple in the process and declares Steelport an independent citystate under the Saints control with Pierce taking charge as mayor and the Boss as the ultimate leader,Saints Row The Third is the first Saints Row game that takes place in the city of Steelport Much like the first two games the story revolves around the Saints destroying and absorbing three rival gangs taking over the city in the process In Saints Row The Third these three gangs are the Morningstar the Luchadores and the Deckers Unlike the first two games these three gangs are all controlled by a criminal organization known as The Syndicate which the

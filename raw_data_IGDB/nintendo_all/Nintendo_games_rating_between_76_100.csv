mission that goes horribly awry However wielding a mysterious book called the White Chronicle Stocke discovers a way to travel to the intersection of time itself Historia With this power in his hands he must travel back and forth through key events and an entirely alternate timeline to right the worlds illfated course The lives of his companions the fate of nations and the resolution of an impending disaster that now threatens the land all depend on Stockes ability to discern the one true history,Warning Spoilers  On the continent of Vainqueur a land of man and beasts the holy nation of the East Alistel is in a state of war with Granorg a massive country to the West that is ruled harshly by Queen Protea Alistels land is slowly turning to desert while a strange disease known as the Sand Plague is turning its people into sand The ruler of Alistel the Prophet Noah insists this worldwide disease is the result of Proteas evil government The people of Alistel thus believe they are fighting a holy war against Granorg  One day Stocke and his subordinates agents with the intelligence agency of Alistel are sent into Granorg territory to rescue a secret agent who was captured by the government of Granorg After saving the agent the group find themselves surrounded by the Granorg army and Stocke is severely wounded He awakens in Historia a world where time and space are warped There two mysterious children Teo and Lippti give him the ability to travel through time and space using the power of a book his employer Heiss gave him the White Chronicle After using this new power to travel through time to avoid defeat Stocke is given a choice continue working under Heiss in the intelligence division or join his friend Roschs unit within the military Each choice creates a timeline and each timeline has its own separate story which nonetheless relates to the other one Stocke is often forced to move between timelines to acquire skills and information he would not otherwise have access to in order to avoid disasters ambushes or simply to position himself properly to take advantage of his enemies or friends  Under Heiss Stocke is sent to Granorg to assassinate Princess Eruca He only manages to enter the city by pretending to be part of a group of traveling entertainers most of whom are Satyros one of the native beastmen races of the continent Among them are Aht a nineyearold shaman who for better or worse begins idolizing Stocke and using her abilities to protect him Once he arrives in Granorg he discovers that the princess knew he would be coming and moreover had not informed anyone else Stocke learns that Eruca is the de facto leader of the resistance against her stepmothers reign and is therefore more an asset to Alistels war on Granorg than an enemy Eruca also reveals that she is the only living descendant of the empires rulers and thus the only person who can perform the ritual to prevent desertification However as Queen Protea refuses to allow her to perform the ritual the world could turn to sand in less than a decade unless Protea is removed from power  Stocke refrains from carrying out the assassination thus securing her support Oddly enough he is also aided in this regard by his appearance which is similar to Erucas late older brother Ernst who was executed by her father for treason Despite his best intentions his failure to complete his mission brands him a traitor in Alistel and General Hugo orders his execution  In the other timeline Stocke is assigned to Roschs unit and deployed to protect Alistels mines from enemy sabotage as well as protect a cavern which is the only route connecting the two mountainous territories of Granorg and Alistel other than a slim valley protected by the ofttraded Sand Fortress After successfully defending the mines Stocke and Rosch are rewarded by General Hugo with promotions but he also assigns them to the Sand Fortress with a platoon of new recruits Alistels secondincommand Lt General Raul assumes this is to remove any possible future political opponents from the city as Field Marshal Viola who also was gaining popularity against Hugos will was also assigned there After defeating the Granorg army in two battles Roschs entire brigade is killed Stocke then discovers a piece of paper proving that the Granorgites were being leaked information from within Alistel  Stocke returns with the critically wounded Rosch to Alistel and taking the advice of Lt General Raul sneaks into Hugos office to search for evidence of deals with Granorg He finds a coded note that he believes to show the truth and promptly flees Alistel with Raul Rosch and Roschs doctor Sonja They arrive in Celestia and learn that Hugo had a secret pact with Proteas advisors Dias and Selvan to eliminate Protea from the throne annex Granorg and then conquer the entire continent Stocke convinces Rosch to become the commander of Celestias army and Celestia prepares for war against Granorg and Alistel  In the history created by Stocke refusing to leave Heiss Stocke finds asylum in the desert nation of Cygnus and convinces King Garland the Mighty to prepare for war against Granorg Eruca then takes him to meet the Gutral tribe who only meet with humans if they bear the sacred Beast Mark Stocke acquires the Mark and recruits the Gutrals to fight against Granorg They depose Protea in doing so obtaining the Etherion a Granorg treasure that can neutralize a weapon designed under the orders of Hugo that turns its victims to sand  Stocke returns to the other timeline recruits the Gutrals using his Beast Mark and enters the annexed Granorg with the Etherion After defeating the Dias Knights and reluctantly killing Viola who chose to remain loyal to Alistel because she believed that the death of her the Valkyrie would convince its troops to give up their fight Stocke discovers that Hugo has been forced into confession by Alistel citizens that Noah was dead the whole time Stocke pursues Hugo to Alistel and slays him  In the final chapter of the True History created by both timelines combining Heiss invades Granorgs Royal Hall where the ritual to stop desertification is performed Stocke confronts him and Heiss explains that the sacrificial victims of the ritual are royals who were killed by their own family and brought back to life by giving them part of their siblings soul During the ritual the Sacrifice dies again and the half of a soul returns to its original body stabilizing the Mana of the continent and thus slowing desertification in the process Stocke is Heiss explains Erucas late brother Ernst who was executed by his father King Victor for treason given a part of a soul by Eruca for use in the ritual and then captured by Heiss who was Victors brother and an intended Sacrifice himself and had his memories modified so hed live the life of Stocke  Heiss believes that the suffering of the royal family which he has seen as a Sacrifice and thus a wielder of the Black Chronicle is caused by their attempts to protect a world that is not worth saving He plans to recruit Stocke to his side leaving Eruca as the only living member of the royal family without any Sacrifices to use but Stocke refuses Heiss then attempts to absorb enough souls to hasten desertification enough to destroy the world altogether so Sacrifices will no longer be necessary He fails and uses the Black Chronicle to take the party to Historia which along with the Chronicles was created with the intention of enlightening Sacrifices resulting in the ritual being more effective He then consumes the suffering of all past Sacrifices and becomes the monster Apocrypha which is destroyed by Stocke and his allies  If the player has not done sufficient sidequests the game ends with Stocke being sacrificed by Eruca to prevent the desertification However it is possible to unlock a better ending in which the player can see the major characters continuing to live out their lives most notably Raynie promises to wait for Stocke to return Viola survives her wounds and is cured of an illness she became afflicted with on the front lines and Rosch and Sonja are married and encounter the soldiers in Roschs brigade whom they thought all dead One of the soldiers explains a man who is implied to be Stocke rescued them Heiss and Stocke wait in Historia during this ideal ending and Heiss forcibly sacrifices himself instead of Stocke seeing the difference Stocke made to the lives of the characters affected by the aforementioned sidequests and realizing the world is worth saving Stocke then returns to the real world  Source Wikipedia
